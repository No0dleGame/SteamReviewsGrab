      "review": "Super fun! If you love unpacking, this is a great game similar to the style of unpacking with the isometric pixel graphics and gameplay. It's not just unpacking either, there's tons of content where you can buy homes or showrooms to furnish with what you find through gameplay as well. If you're a sims 4/house flipper/any furnishing game then you'll definitely like that aspect of freedom too. Lots of variety, lots of challenges, plenty of content. The story is cute, the localization is fine (devs are chinese - the game has plenty of chinese culture referenced in it, but also has seasonal decor from other cultures worldwide. the dia de los muertos stuff was a pleasant surprise lmao) \nhighly, highly, highly recommend. the price of the game compared to the content is absolutely stellar!",

I beat the main story and still have some little areas to work on, which I fully intend to do. I deeply enjoyed this game. With that being said, yes I'm going to be that person. It would have been nice to have a customized character. There really isn't a reason why we have to choose between two genders and one skin tone in 2025. It could have just been pick the body frame, pick the skin tone, pick the hair, and be done with it. That was my only hang up with this game. That, and a tiny bit more guidance could have been given.  However, this game easily paid for itself.",

I opted to not go out and try to get all the collectible furniture. In the end, I wasn't as drawn to the designing aspect of each room as much as I was during Unpacking. The convenience stores felt very unsatisfying in particular because there didn't feel to be a good way to organize everything to my own satisfaction due to some of the pixel constraints. Not being able to put all the soda bottles in the fridge because only certain rows could double stack, etc.\r\n\r\nThis was a fun time, don't get me wrong. But I think Unpacking did the UI of this concept much better and with a more cohesive story line and didn't even use words.",

All that said I did pour 12 numbed-out hours into this before I felt like there was nothing left for me, which is pretty good value for the sale price.",

There are some wonky parts to it- it isn't the most intuitive thing to play (I had to use a walk-through because the game doesn't explain much to you), and it does have some English localization issues (I can understand everything as a native English speaker, but I did have to read some things a few times to understand what the game meant). Overall, though, it is a pretty enjoyable game that clearly had a lot of love poured into it. It's a decent investment if you're looking to play a relatively short game that has some chill post-game content. I managed to beat the game in about eight hours of laid-back play, but I can still continue to play and decorate little houses.",

Isso, na minha opinião, torna o jogo profundo e cria uma atmosfera acolhedora, que faz o jogador se sentir parte daquela história.\n\nJoguei por 10 horas até platinar, e com certeza vou continuar por muito mais tempo graças ao alto fator de replay. Mesmo após o fim da história principal, a rejogabilidade permanece praticamente intacta - o jogo parece te chamar para continuar explorando, testando cores, mobílias e combinações de decoração. É [i] surrealmente [/i] divertido e relaxante.\n\n[quote=Whisper of the House] May the light never fade, and your kindness remain forever. [/quote]",

Organizing rooms and enjoying the \"spooky\" anomalies was especially calming. The game motivates you to interact with the objects you are unpacking or organizing. That being said, it is not that hard to find the anomalies and such. Some may think that is a bad thing, but I believe the game is charming in that it is easy to do the task you set out to do and relax. If you are looking for a spooky game, Whisper of the House is not it. However, it is still enjoyable regardless. The game reminds me of the game \"Unpacking\" which I also enjoyed a ton!",

The puzzles weren't too hard, I didn't have to look anything up, and figuring out everything was very satisfying.\r\nI would rec this game to fans of Unpacking - that's what I thought it might be like, and I was right!",

I want to find more similar indie games like this, or I hope the developers make a sequel!",

The pixel art is amazing and very expressive. Overall, if you like a game where you decorate homes you'll most likely like it. If you like solving mysteries, you'll have fun with all the secrets the game holds.\r\n\r\nA couple of things I didn't really like:\r\n- The decorating feels kind of limited. You can't change the color of most items and the color selection is very limited, even with the color picker tool. You can't really mess with saturation all that much and some colors come out very bright or very dark.\r\n\r\n- Almost all the bathrooms were absolutely tiny so you are very limited to how much detail you can put in them. You can't even change the shape of your bathroom and are stuck with the walk in shower set up.\r\n\r\n-The ending felt a little disappointing but it does wrap everything up nicely. So it wasn't a bad ending just a bit anti-climatic.\r\n\r\n*SPOILERS*\r\n\r\n\r\n- The houses you get as rewards near the end of the game are basically just theme rooms and you can't change the wallpaper or flooring. Which I find very odd, since you given these homes and not like, reselling them/renting them out.",

My only real complain is that there is no character customization and the gameplay gets extremely repetitive after you complete the main story line. The side jobs repeat frequently, it starts to feel like there is really nothing else to do. Overall it's great and definitely worth the $15. <3",

      "review": "I absolutely ADORE cozy games (and more so when they've got a little kick to them). Whisper of the House (WotH) is a charming and cute indie pixel art game where you work as an interior designer by helping clients settle in the town. But that aside, you also notice over time how some tidbits look and feel unusual and mysterious - creepy, even. \r\n\r\nComparing this to Unpacking is a disservice to both games! While both are about making a home, WotH feels more free; in a sense that the player can place whatever they want wherever. Not only do you get to decorate people's houses as well, but also your own! It's an optional side that you can do with an extra feature of gacha on furniture by using \"tickets\" you get from completing missions and rummaging through trash (which is the best part of the game fr)\r\n\r\nIn comparison to Unpacking, WotH feels more episodic. It places value in each client's personal story through the way they want their home decorated in contrast to Unpacking where you only really look at only one person's life. Despite this difference, both games are outstanding in their own right and both WotH AND Unpacking are very deserving of praise for its cozy, comforting, and zen vibe.\r\n\r\nOverall, this game is wonderful and if you're an avid cozy game enjoyer for room designing w really good graphic and visual design like me, you are sure to love experiencing this game as much as I did. Easiest 9/10!",

I initially got into it for the pixel art and the process of packing stuff away into rooms piece by piece until it looks perfect; but there's so much story and mystery to the game. The main characters have their own backstory and the game plays out beautifully as you find anomalies and charming hidden details in every shop and home you work in. Even though the day is passing there's no pressure to complete a project immediately so you can take your time to figure out where everything goes and interact with different objects for fun little secrets. I received this product as a gift but I would have no issues spending full price. A lovely cosy game to pass the time.",

It’s cute on the surface but has moments that feel surprisingly unsettling in a good way.\n\nThe church in the graveyard honestly made me extremely anxious, but that’s part of what makes the game so engaging. It balances that uneasy atmosphere with moments of calm and curiosity, creating a really unique experience.\n\nOverall, it’s a relaxing game with just the right touch of mystery and eeriness. Perfect if you enjoy slow-paced exploration and light puzzle-solving with a slightly spooky twist!",

Além disso os desenvolvedores estão constantemente atualizando o jogo e consertando bugs, o que tem sido ótimo. Ouvi dizer que estão preparando conteúdo adicional e vou ficar de olho, aguardando ansiosamente!\r\n\r\nO único feedback construtivo que gostaria de realçar é que eu adoraria ter uma escolha maior de móveis e decorações com a possibilidade de girar todos os items em 360  degraus e trocar as cores, porém ainda é possível ser bem criativo com os itens que disponibilizaram até o momento :)\r\n",

I LOVED the game Unpacking so so much, so I just knew this one would be right up (or is it down?) my alley. \n\nThere’s something so deeply satisfying about unpacking and decorating each little space. Every room has its own story, and I found myself slowing down just to get things “right.” The whole process scratches that same cozy itch as cleaning or organizing in real life... but minus the mess, of course. \n\nI also love how much personality it has. There are hidden surprises when you interact with random objects, and a few cheeky pop culture references that actually made me laugh. It feels like the devs had fun making this, and that vibe totally comes through.\n\n100 % done and dusted in 8 ish hours, so I am not unhappy.",

Все, что нужно делать в игре - кайфовать, медитативно расставлять предметы и кайфовать еще больше!\r\n\r\nБольшие плюсы, которые привлекли мое внимание:\r\n1. Визуал. Приятная яркая пиксельная графика добавляет шарма игре про декорирование микро-комнаток.\r\n2. Сюжет. Порадовало, что здесь есть пара зАгАдОЧнЫх моментов и даже концовка.\r\n3. Атмосфера и таинственность. Меня покорил уровень с кладбищем и церковью, бууу\r\n4. Интерактивность. Почти всё в этой игре можно потискать и пожмякать, сплошной восторг!\r\n\r\nНебольшие минусы:\r\n1. Нет перевода на русский. Приходилось иногда напрягать голову, чтобы прочитать описания персонажей или понять, что за предмет и куда его ставить. В игре хочется расслабиться, но инглиш порой напрягал (хотя я его более менее знаю)\r\n2. Вкусновато, но маловато. сюжет, как по мне, очень быстро кончился, хоть и прошло 10 часов. Мне не хватило таинственности, все вроде как начали закручивать и тут бам, музей открылся, а там уже и концовка. ХОЧУ ИСЧО!\r\n3. Гача. Покупка предметов для дизайна через гачу - подлость (особенно ради ачивки)\r\n\r\nВ целом, игра вообще супер, похожих на нее не знаю, очень порадовала, рекомендую!!!",

It's also re-sparked the artist in me to make these isometric pieces! \r\n\r\nYes, it is a short game, but it has replay ability. I haven't yet gone through the whole town and I certainly will be playing this again. \r\n\r\nThank you Developer for this wonderfully cute game! I appreciate the time invested in this work and I really hope to see more!",

Will highly recommend it if you enjoy games like Unpacking and wish you could do the same for other NPC's and not just for the main character. There is such a variety in tasks you need to do (Decorate your own home / Unpack how you want / Unpack but the way I want you to / I have this idea with a few items and want you to add to it) which makes every task feel different! Not to mention the subtle storylines going on as well!\r\n\r\nOnly downside is that the main story with the pyramid feels a bit out of place? Might be cause it wasn't there during the demo, but the way it ties in to our experience felt a bit out of place (might just be me though, but I kind of thought there would be more to it based on how strange some of the 'glitch' interactions were).\r\n\r\nI think we also get wayyyy too much vouchers for tasks (and too quickjly)! Let us grind and work for those furnishing pieces to decorate our homes! I do love that the gatcha furnishing stores prioritise giving you new items rather than copies of already-obtained versions (you can buy copies at the mall at least!) to ensure that you can unlock all items easier rather than it being a pure gatcha.",

And oh boy, it did NOT disappoint. \n\n!!!MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n\nTake Unpacking, give it an entire town with a mildly disconcerting story line, NPCs with cryptic lines, news papers with eerie text, even a POCKET DIMENSION in a wizards house????? \n\nThis game is fantastic and I've already played it for like almost 8 hours straight. 11/10 would recommend and worth the price.",

I love the small details that they add in the game to keep you hooked and learn more about each character and even the town itself. If you love organizing games with a good story that leaves mysteries for you to uncover that makes you want more then this is the game for you :3! \n\nPros: \nI love the art style and it is aesthetically pleasing\nCats everywhere! \nThere is a gacha system (kinda like loot boxes but you don't pay actual money)\nSmall details that are left to hint at a characters backstory to show it completed meaning they took great care in telling the story not leaving it completely unfinished but leaving it up to gamer to build off and piece together.\n\nI don't any cons as of yet because Idk if they will continue to add more updates to add more to the map or more things to do with your own personal home. Plus I only have 14 hours in the game so far. I hope this helps :)!",

It's not extremely grindy like stardew valley you can express your creativity really early on and there are styles for many different types of people. Not to mention you can endlessly play and redo rooms/shops to your hearts content which you will wanna do after progressing even more & unlocking more furniture. IT'S EXTREMELY SATISFYING U WILL SPEND HOURS DECORATING UR DREAM HOUSE/SHOPS LOVE love love it. ^o^\n\n+ If you love cats.......they are sprinkled all over the map! And the loading screen transitions from cats to hearts to teddy bears like pls can this game get any better >_<\n\n++ You won't be judged for digging in the trash like in stardew.",

Nothing is too hard, while not a lot is explained, context clues are all over the place (as well as notes in some homes to help, of course), and after figuring something out, getting that achievement really boosts the incentive to keep playing. \r\nI like that theirs a mini collection system in the game too, with decorations you can pull from shops.

I downloaded this game last night and played for over 4 hours into the wee hours of the morning (3 am lol). This game is amazingly put together. Along with satisfying organizational tasks/game play, there is an overarching story that I have barely scratched the surface of. So many things about this game are beautiful: the graphics, the sound track, the story so far. I am so happy I stumbled upon this game!",

The furniture/decor collection progress is great, there is a broad range of decor types and level challenges to incentivize progress.

The dev team is still actively working on it and doing bug fixes so I won't mention the ones I've encountered as I'm sure they're already fixed. It has a tame but still present unnerving vibe(?) It's hard to explain and I don't think spooky really describes the feeling and atmosphere but I would describe it as mildly disturbing in the sense you might feel a tad uneasy. This feeling is very scant and only really ramps up in the latter end of the game and i enjoyed it as it adds a layer of suspense. That said, the ending feels accurate to the story's progression but it falls a bit flat. Just a tad underwhelming and the plot of the game is very minimal.\n\nDespite the minimal plot, I enjoyed the overall game because I love organizing simulators and it's art style adds a fresh and exciting look to it compared to most other organization simulators (the only other organization game that ive played that has pixel art like whisper of the house is Unpacking by Witchbeam). I like the customization but i feel it could be more robust. All in all, it's a solid game it just might not be as polished as one may expect as the devs are still finding their footing for the game, but I don't mind that as the gameplay is the main draw for me and this game definitely has some replayability for me.",

      "review": "A very cute pixel organizing game similar to \"Unpacking\", albeit with a background Christian bent, where \"Unpacking\" was made by a Jewish developer and had Jewish elements (which is unfortunately rather unique in the video game space). That being said, \"Whisper of the House\" was a bit more enjoyable than \"Unpacking\" in some ways, in that the quests were quite fun, it didn't crash (though it had a number of lag issues that looked like near-crashes), and it identified objects for the player to move around. It's also a little longer and there's more stuff to do, although that made it a bit overwhelming at times, and I think the game is more targeted at people who like to make cute house designs than people who just like organizing things.\n\nOne of my main criticisms of \"Unpacking\" was that I didn't know what all the objects you handle were, so it was hard to figure out which room was the correct one for them. Although \"Whisper of the House\" generally sticks you in the right room for whatever object you're given (with the option of switching rooms as needed, though this is rarely necessary outside personal desire), the game also not only names whatever the object is, but also describes it. The descriptions aren't always useful, but the naming is.\n\nThere are issues with near-crashing: whenever a character would I think leave a screen, the screen would go entirely black, and the game would very obviously lag. During the end cutscene, the game froze, and then jumped a couple seconds forward. I also recall dealing with leg on clicking things at times (particularly with the gacha stuff), which was frustrating. While I appreciate the game is self-contained and has no microtransactions while containing gacha design elements, like games like \"Vampire Survivors\", I found this pretty aggravating because it does the \"Kirby and the Forgotten Land\" thing, where you can get repeat items rather than drawing from a narrower pool. This was irritating in \"Astro Bot\" as well, where you could spend hard-earned money to buy junk instead of items from the remaining pool. Considering just how many items there are in the game and how many pulls you have to do on average for them, it's very silly that you can collect things you already have when doing pulls, especially when it has no microtransactions so there's no intelligent reason to keep people making pulls, other than that's just how gacha tends to work.\n\nThe pixel art is very cute, and I appreciated the slight \"Stardew Valley\" and \"Gravity Falls\" vibes, with plenty of clear love for Studio Ghibli. The game does feel a bit overwhelming in moments, with a fast day-to-night cycle (that admittedly doesn't do anything other than matter for I think one item), and a small deluge of quests you get at once, until you discover everything is basically optional and the map has a pin system so you can set markers for yourself to go to if you get lost. The freedom and sense of narrative is nice, but I did appreciate \"Unpacking\"'s more linear narrative.\n\nI was also really confused, from a narrative angle, why the game keeps giving you [spoiler]homes to live in. By the time the ending rolled around, I'd gotten a handful of places to live in, on top of living rent free(?) in two different apartments, so I was a bit confused why I was meant to be excited about being gifted a house and too much stuff to stick in it, cute as the furniture is[/spoiler]. This is why I pointed out that the game seems more geared towards folks who like rearranging pretty fake houses than folks who like organizing, because this game design aspects seems to be geared towards giving the former more of what they want. And that's great for the former, but a bit underwhelming if you're not as into that part and just want puzzle-solving. I'm also a bit disappointed [spoiler]we didn't get to have a pet. The mysterious dog is never explained, and we don't get to keep the cat(s) that are wandering around. But I did appreciate the aquarium[/spoiler]. Additionally, while the town is nice, [spoiler]it's mostly empty. So the town aspect (rather than just focused on building to building, as \"Unpacking\" does) felt a bit wasted, since most of the neat-looking buildings and areas aren't places you can visit[/spoiler]. I also wish there were more buildings with [spoiler]people showing you where to put things. I get it defeats the purpose for some stuff, but it was satisfying in its own way[/spoiler].\n\nFrom a designer point, storage was also quite irritating. The [spoiler]present boxes are very cute, for instance, but you can neither store nor even trash them, so they just filled up my basement[/spoiler].\n\nIt was also very weird to find [spoiler]when you click the cop car, whoever's in it says \"Comrade\", like... the  pigs are communists? I'm so confused. I also wonder why a police station that serves no purpose (other than removing an unhoused person off-screen) was more important than other town facilities, like a dump or a school[/spoiler].\n\nThis can also be very hard on your hands, given some segments require continuous clicking. \"Gemporium\" actually had an accessibility feature for this, allowing a single button press to replace multiple ones. It was frustrating not to see that here.\n\nGenerally, though, it's a simple little game, with cute designs and fun puzzles. If you liked \"Unpacking\", you'll probably like this. If you liked this, you should try \"Unpacking\".",

If you have a lot of imagination, there's a lot of empty houses or requests you could even do after you are done with the story part of the game. I do wish the game had leaned more into the spooky mystery side, I was expecting more of it after the first mission with Luna and the hidden room, as well as the cryptic letters. But even without that spooky aspect, it is still a hard recommend, the style is very cute, lots of furniture for you to have fun with, and different type of missions and achievement for you to get. I hope they'll consider doing more of this type of games in the future, or maybe even DLCs with different parts of the town to unlock!",

Also i hated having restrictions where to place certain things.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ you have sooo much freedom upon decorating the rooms, i love it. You feel the bedroom would be so much better if used as living room and vice versa? Np, you can just swap stuff around as you wish\r\n+ the furniture catalog is huge\r\n+ you dont have to grind for anything, there are gamba lootboxes yes, but the game is pretty generous when it comes to unlocking new items, there wasn't a single item i had struggle to get\r\n+ the achievemts are just the right mix of difficulty, while most are pretty easy and picked up along the way, for some you have to think a little further\r\n\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- i loved the little story aspect of the game, but i felt the ending was falling rather short and kinda leaves you hanging\r\n- not all items can be turned 180°, especially bigger ones are often sadly only 90°,\r\n- wish we could actually use the wigs and costumes we find and not only showcase them",

You progrses through the story, uncovering this mystery, and then all of a sudden the quests are over with no warning. I thought I had a bug in my game or had missed something I needed to be able to progress, but I had just finished the main questline.\r\nI really enjoyed the actual mechanics and story of the game, but it needs more quests (please!!), or at least some sort of ending quest that lets the player know they have finished the main story. I played for a few hours and payed most of the optional decorating tasks as well, but overall, the game is just too short for the price it is, and feels like it is lacking an ending.",

      "review": "Reviewing (mostly) every game (or DLC) in my library, part 383:\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (9/10)\n\n[i]Whisper of the House [/i]is a much better [i]Unpacking[/i]—but with a mysterious, paranormal spin. Suddenly you’re not just organizing a life, you’re uncovering one. As a cozy, home-decor sim, it hits a sweet spot where every dusty corner, mismatched painting, and forgotten trinket feels like part of a secret waiting to breathe. Also, it came out on my birthday, so of course it's going to be great :P\n\n🚪[b] Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Cozy decor meets haunting secrets. On surface duty, you’re unpacking, placing furniture, helping clients move in or reorganize, and styling spaces. But there’s always a sense something’s off—hidden rooms, anomalies, whispers behind walls. That duality between comfort and unease is the game’s strongest trick. And then suddenly, you're investigating time travel portals, ghosts, and alien weirdness?!?! This game has more depth than you think.\n\n[*]Creative freedom and satisfying aesthetic. This is the highlight of the game. The requirements are not as strict as in [i]Unpacking[/i]: most missions will let you put items anywhere. And let me tell you, there are so many items in the missions, and even more when you're decorating your (multiple!) houses. There has to be at least 1,000 items in the game. The pixel art is beautiful, as well. And so colorful! The pixel art is rich and textured, every lamp, plant, or shelf feels lovingly crafted. You can tell the difference between regular milk and strawberry milk.\n\n[*]Charming characters and companion robot. Mark, your robot helper, is a delight. Their expressions, little moments of panic when you pick them up by mistake—those touches make the town feel alive. NPCs and clients are simple, but their quirks give personality to the spaces you inhabit, and their designs are very sweet. There's also a guide to everyone you meet, which is very appreciated.\n\n[*]Ambient audio and soundtrack.The music is cozy, but with just enough wistful tension. It's charming for sure. Visuals and sound together make late-night decorating feel evocative. \n\n[*] Lots of fun and quick achievements that I don't think are missable.\n\n[*] The UI (except for a little nitpick) is very good, especially when searching for items. You can sort by room or by function, and you can search things up by name. I wish, however, that the menus for searching items was bigger on the right side. \n[/list]\n\n📫[b] Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] My biggest con is that the description text over items is both extremely small and difficult to see. The text is black with a white outline, which creates a hazy effect behind the words. Sometimes the words blend in with the background. The text can def be bigger.\n\n[*] Mechanics sometimes feel clunky. Rotation limitations (you sometimes can't rotate items fully), camera rules (you can’t rotate rooms), and tight spaces might frustrate your interior ambitions. But for the most part, the game is very flexible. \n\n[*]Translation and dialogue roughness. A few lines feel awkward or stilted—likely due to localization. Some NPC or client text don't flow super cleanly.\n[/list]",

I liked when the rooms had a specific setting and the owner/character asked you for help organizing and placing their belongings around freely. The empty rooms and those rooms where the character specifically pointed you to where they wanted each furniture/item were ok but that mode was definitely my favorite. I also liked it so much that I got all achievements (I never do that) and one good thing I found out is that achievements are, well, achievable! compared to other games where there's always a few that are almost impossible to do. So that was a relief and a happy surprise!\nThe art and details of each item plus commentary was also delightful!!! \nI seriously Seriously loved this game.",

      "review": "I DEFINITELY recommend this game if you're looking for that Unpacking feeling - but I'll go even further and say: to me this game is better in so many ways. (but also very different and with a different purpose! not trying to say Unpacking isn't good, just stating my preference here!)\n\n- First of all, the art is absolutely adorable and straight-up beautiful.\n- You can walk around the map and interact with things in the city. It's so fun and the city isn't too big so it's not a bother to go from one place to another.\n- You get requests from residents to clean or/and renovate their home or their work place, from duplex to bakery, flower shop, magic atelier... There's a good variety of places to decorate, you'll never get bored.\n- There's no restriction when decorating, which means you place the items wherever you want!\n- The stories of the residents are entertaining and cute. I wasn't expecting anything special but I was honestly surprised to find myself enjoying them and the humor of the game is all cute and giggles too.\n- Daylies and side stories! And a newspaper system that gives you hints about them every day!\n- There's mystery to solve in the story! It makes you want to discover more and gives the game a little more liveliness.\n- There's a lot of items to unlock. The catalog of items is well-balanced. Having to buy them doesn't feel frustrating either because you get \"money\" pretty easily after a while anyway. If you like to 100% your games, don't worry, you'll be able to. Not too easily but not hard to achieve either!\n- You get your own home to decorate as you wish, loved that part. And you don't HAVE to do it either, it doesn't change anything to the main story whether you do it or not so you can just skip it if you prefer to focus on the residents.\n- You can enter any place you previously decorated and decorate it again. I never did it but I thought it nice.\n\nOverall, I spent around 15-16 hours to complete the game and oh I wished it never ended! I absolutely loved it and I hope there'll be a new one, or at least a DLC.\nI do think some details could've been better here and there (more variety in the OSTs and the ability to rotate all items 360°) but honestly, with the game being so good AND cheap, I'm not complaining about it at all. I honestly wasn't expecting that much content in the first place.\n\nIf you're hesitating to give it a try, please just go for it. This is easily one of the best decorating games ever! (at least to me :))",

I think for it's price it's certainly worth it if you're wanting a cozy organization game, so I can't not recommend it.\n\nHowever, I do have a few gripes about this game. First off, there's sort of a story happening, but it's rather unclear and the main quests I was getting through the mail just kind of stopped at some point without any fan fair or explanation as to why? I assume I just ran out of quests, but I would have thought it would be a little bit clearer about it, such as giving me end credits or saying it was the final quest. Maybe I'm not actually done, but I've spent another hour or so in the game and haven't gotten any more quests so I am unsure ahah. It seems weird to me to establish a system for playing the game and then abandon it. And the mystery is till pretty much unknown to me?\n\nWhen it comes to the levels, I enjoyed them, tho some of the items seemed a bit too cluttery (leaving me a little stressed as to how/where I'm supposed to put some of them as a lot of the levels aren't given space for the clutter - such as one of the house levels gives you a bunch of kitchen items but there is only like 3 counter spaces and there aren't any drawers or shelves to put things into), or the levels seemed too structured, where they would just tell you where to put items or give you items that very clearly have set spots they would fit best, such as the shelves in the convenience store. I just would have liked to see a little more thought in some places to make it feel like we had more freedom.\n\nI also don't enjoy that only some items are customizable color wise, and it's not clear which items are and are not until you put them down and try. For example, there are counters that you can change the color for, but the sink version of that counter can't be changed, so it won't match if you change the color. I would love some clarity in the game, maybe an icon or something next to the item that just says it's dyable. I think this is because the button to customize and the button to interact is the same, so for the sink when you interact it just turns the water on, but it's still a bit frustrating. \n\nThere are a few other minor things that I didn't love about the game, and I will say that I am a little disappointed since everybody in the reviews has been raving about how good/interesting the story is and how fun the gameplay is, and I'm not sure it quite lives up to that, but it is a fun game and I'm hoping to play a bit more, in hopes of understanding the mystery/story. There are also a lot of things that I think this game does well!",

Yet there is more going on than initially meets the eye. The town is cursed. Someone is watching you. Locate and fix anomalies, and find out who's really in charge of Whisper Town.\r\nI really enjoyed this game! It had some elements that reminded me of Unpacking, but I had a whole town to work with, and I loved decorating my home with items I collected along the way. A bit of a darker bend at times, but it lends just that little bit of mystery to an otherwise pretty chill game.",

The hidden objects and renovation mechanics are both engaging and surprisingly challenging, which made the gameplay satisfying overall.\n\nI played it on the Steam Deck OLED, and while it runs well, there are a few small issues. The text can be a bit too small sometimes, which makes reading a bit tricky on the Deck’s screen. There are also moments when you’ll need to use non–Steam Deck controls, so I occasionally had to rely on the touchscreen features to navigate.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that the renovation color overlay doesn’t disappear after clicking, so I have to exit the room just to remove the color box. Not sure if that’s a Deck-only issue or if it happens on PC too.\n\nStill the puzzles, atmosphere, and relaxing vibe totally make up for those small hiccups. Hopefully, future updates polish it even more, and looking forward for more contents because it’s such a fun and cozy game overall.",

The problem is right about the time I was getting really excited, gearing up to have to solve a mystery with the breadcrumbs I had found... it ended. No signs that the main quests were wrapping up, no final puzzles, nothing. It was just over. I was waiting for the next letter to come give me my next tasks (which I expected because there are a lot of buildings in the town and some of the quests are very interesting takes on the character's role), but nothing showed up. The mystery underscoring the whole time is wildly anticlimactic. \r\n\r\nOn a more petty note of dislike, one of the houses you unlock to decorate is hot pink and bright orange with no way to change those colors. I hate bright orange.\r\n\r\nAll told, it's not a bad game: some of the tasks are nice and relaxing, the design is nice, and you can pet a lot of cats, but in terms of story it's really a letdown.",

It's fun for a minute until your realise you're the only person in town with a functional brain. \n\nPerfect Design - the townspeople love it!\nAbysmal Design - the townspeople love it! \n\nIn one house, I literally put all the food on the floor in a kitchen and blocked the access to the rest of the house by piling baskets, and proceeded to the bedroom where i put the washer on top of the box spring on one side of the room, then took my mattress to the other side of the room and put my shelves full of items on top of that. \n\nWhat did my client think? Outstanding work!! Mission Complete!\n\nI guess I don't see the point in playing a game where I can literally plunk anything down anywhere and win.  I had hoped there would be some sort of ranking system based on how well you put the house together but its entirely based on just getting the items put down.\n\nI suppose in this game I could organise homes nicely for my own self satisfaction but I mean if I'm doing that, I may as well do the work in my real house and have something to show for it.",

      "review": "In an increasingly volatile market, within which consumers are expected to satiate executives' greed via microtransactions and expansions, Whisper of the House reminds gamers that pixels do not have to welcome waves of poverty. You will not find a limited edition 1978 refrigerator with an exclusive vinyl wrapping for $1544.99 here, but you can head over to the appliance store and buy yourself an adorable, stylized fridge in a variety of designs. You get multiple residences to decorate freely, as well as gently-guided tasks tidying and rebirthing your town's businesses and homes. You can return to redecorate depending on your current, real season to get seemingly endless time in this sci-fi dipped world. Whisper of the House drips cozy decor, calming atmosphere, and compassionate tales, and it will provide mental sanctuary when you need most. Click one button in your inventory to collect all within a room, breathe, and start again.\n\nA couple notes I had after completing Whisper of the House:\n- The description of the cane in the hospital being \"usually used by old people\" or something along that wording is inaccurate, as canes are used by disabled people. Disabled people can always utilize a mobility aid like a cane, but old people might end up using one eventually. \n- I want to be able to buy mobility aids and other accessibility devices when first starting out, like purchasing any other furniture piece or food item. I want wheelchairs, crutches, walkers, canes, changing tables, talk pads, ventilators, feeding tube equipment, etc. in my little whisper of a world. \n- If customizing your character is introduced, introduction of choosing your character being in a wheelchair or wearing casts/braces to traverse the town would be nice! When I see equipment such as grandpa's chair lift and the hospital's I.V. systems, I feel like I am less alien in my real life, like I don't need to hide my equipment and accommodations, and I feel empowered. But I dream of a future in which kiddos are gifted an affordable, accessible game and actually see themselves alive, welcome, and normal out with the rest of their community.",

A lot of cosy games are cosy activities happening in a cosy world, where bad things either don't occur or aren't occurring near you, but Whisper of the House is more sophisticated. Yes, you're helping people and tidying things up in a cute pixel world, but you'll finish decorating and step back outside into the pervading feeling that things are wrong, and most people can't see this, and only you can fix it. It's only very light supernatural horror but its inclusion really does elevate the game from a happy afternoon or two to something I'll keep thinking about for a good while.",

I love myself a cozy game where you can just decorate and feel good and this game gives exactly that. I did not expect so much customization and details and it does go beyond the typical point and place. There is a mystery story to the game, homes to decorate freely as you please, plentiful catalog of items to select from and unique game play within the game play. I may be a bit sucked into the game right now.\nMy warning is to set time aside to play, because you might catch yourself playing for hours straight just arranging and decorating. I absolutely recommend to players that enjoyed \"Animal Crossing\", \"Unpacking\" \"Disney Dreamlight Valley\" or \"Stardew Valley\", as it carries different vibes from each game.",

On the other hand one home is sufficient. Or if anything it should've been 3 homes maximum in my opinion. \nI have nothing much to say about the story because I think the main focus is really on the decorating part.

My expectations were linked to unpacking -- which I did enjoy but eventually found boring and quite short.\n\nI felt a tad nervous starting this game and expecting to refund it -- worrying I was wasting my time, despite the recommendations. [i] I was SO wrong! [/i]\n\nYes you are unpacking people's houses, but they add amazing puzzles to keep it entertaining. There is a story where it actually caught me quite off guard and scared me a bit - LOL!\n\n[b] Semi- Early Game Spoilers (not SUPER crazy spoilers - just fun to find/ figure out on your own) [/b]\n[spoiler] What actually got me what the Alchemist house. Needing to find pages, herbs, and other items to make potions really caught my attention, leading to opening a hidden portal. Of course the hidden crack in the wall at Luma's scared the Sh*t out of me BAD, lol. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, if you like organizing, puzzles, and a bit of mystery - buy it! I spent so much time on it for the first run through, which is SO rare for me! I truly enjoyed this game a lot, and plan to keep playing, NO refund needed. ;)",

It’s cozy and satisfying. \n\nThe only 2 complaints I have are: \n1) As far as my research goes, there’s no option to change the layout of your houses, make them bigger and in some you can’t even change the wallpaper which is a bit frustrating in a game that focuses on customization and decoration;\n2) The story is short and feels a bit rushed. \n\nI feel like if the devs added more options for customization, added more furniture styles and expanded the story, that would truly be a game that many would come back to for years to come.\n\nThere is legitimately so much room here to expand and add new content that I truly wish they won’t let this opportunity to fizzle out.\n",

      "review": "This game scratches an itch I didn't even know I had. \n\nI love games with creative elements, especially when you have your own base or room to organize and design in some way. A lot of games have this now, but it's rarely ever part of the core game play. Then you have other games where creativity and design *are* part of the core game play, but those tend to feel more like casual sandboxes.\n\nThis game figured out how to do both in a way that feels like a creative sandbox that's also engaging and objective-based, with an intriguing mystery unfolding at the same time. One minute, you're cleaning and organizing a house for a new tenant. The next minute, you stumble upon a secret [spoiler] alchemy workshop where you learn how to mix a potion to traverse the astral plane into another dimension [/spoiler]. You know, standard decorating stuff. \n\nThe library of items to decorate with is very large (much more than vanilla SIms these days). There are several themed sets that can all be mixed and matched to your hearts desire. You purchase items from shops via \"mystery boxes\" that contain a mix of common and rare items. So, it's a little tricky to get a full matching set right away, but you can recycle items you don't want for currency, and there are many ways to get more money to buy more stuff, or even to find new items out in the world. \n\nNo objective is ever exactly the same. It's a very engaging experience. The world is immersive. The attention to detail is [chef's kiss]. The sound design and music are great. This game is a new favorite genre of mine, and it's in a league of it's own. I really hope they add to it with DLC or make a sequel in the future. For now, I'm enjoying the heck of this.",

      "review": "여러 사람들의 집 안 가구를 배치해 주고 청소를 해 주는 인테리어 담당자가 되어, 주민들과 친해지며 마을의 비밀을 알아가는 이야기.\n\nWhisper of the House 는 Whisper 마을의 하우스키퍼로 취직한 이후 여러 명의 주민들을 만나 그들의 부탁 (집 안 가구 배치를 적절하게 해주기) 를 들어주고 각 인물들에 대해 가볍게 알아간다는 기본적인 스토리라인에, 마을 전체를 이곳저곳 돌아다니며 찾을 수 있는 기묘한 물체들을 하나하나 해체하면서 마을 속 숨겨진 비밀들을 찾는 기묘한 이야기가 겹쳐져 있는 게임이다. 전자의 경우, \"어 이거 뭔가 익숙하네?\" 라고 느껴질 수 있는 게임플레이인데, 약 4년 전 출시한 Unpacking 을 플레이 해 봤다면 매우 익숙한 맛을 여기서 다시 한 번 맛볼 수 있다. 여러 가지 자잘한 가구들과 사물들을 하나씩 꺼내서 집 안에 차곡차곡 쌓아가는 재미와, 비좁은 공간 안에 원하는 대로 가구들을 배치하다가 게임과 싸우는 나 자신을 보게 될 것이다. 사실 이 과정을 순수하게 재미로 따진다면 그렇게 재미와 도파민이 넘쳐나는 게임은 아니다. 몇백 개의 디지털 오브젝트들을 마우스로 눌러 드래그하면서 배치하는 과정을 재미있게 느끼는 사람은 많지 않지만, 재미의 범위를 좀 더 넓게 잡아서 \"머리를 비우고 무아지경의 상태에 빠져서 화면 속 물체들을 정렬하는 데서 오는 편안함\" 을 재미의 일부분으로 볼 수 있다면, 이런 유형의 게임 (직소 퍼즐 맞추기, 생활 시뮬레이션 게임 플레이 등등) 을 재미있게 할 사람은 많을 것이다. 그런 의미에서, Unpacking 도 그렇고 이 게임도 그렇고 솔직히 말해서 사이버 노동 게임에 가까운 게임플레이를 보여주고 있지만, 여러 집 안 가구 배치를 하는 데에서 재미와 편안함을 느낄 수 있었고, 비록 특정 사이드 컨텐츠 (게임 내 재화를 벌 수 있는 반복 퀘스트로, 사람들이 원하는 테마의 방을 만들어 주면 되는 퀘스트가 있는데, 개인적으로 메인 스토리까지 딱 즐기는 데서 게임이 줄 수 있는 편안함 게이지를 모두 채웠기 때문에, 게임플레이가 노동으로 느껴지는 역치점을 넘기기 전에 엔딩을 보고 게임을 껐다) 를 즐기지는 않았으나 엔딩을 볼 때까지 게임플레이가 너무 불쾌하게 느껴지지 않았다. 만약 이 평가를 쓰는 사람의 Unpacking 평가를 읽었다면 \"아니 그 게임은 비추천을 남겼으면서 이 게임은 왜 추천을 남겼냐?\" 라고 물어볼 수 있다. 그 이유는 사실 게임의 세부적인 구조의 차이에서 볼 수 있는데, Unpacking 의 경우 게임의 처음부터 끝까지 한 인물이 나이를 먹으면서 이사하는 과정을 그린 게임이라, 좋게 보면 스토리라인이 일관성을 지니고 있어서 괴랄하게 느껴질 부분이 없다는 장점이 있고, 나쁘게 보면 스토리가 정말 잔잔하다 못해 아무런 파동이 느껴지지 않는 호수를 관찰하는 기분이라 스토리 면에서는 꽤 지루했다는 단점이 있다. 왜 캐주얼 힐링 게임에서 스토리 이야기를 꺼내냐고 할 수 있지만, 게임플레이가 짐을 풀고 가구를 정리하는 큰 구조에서 절대로 벗어나지 않으며 모든 스테이지가 너무 비슷비슷하게 느껴지기 때문에 스토리라도 멱살잡고 플레이어의 관심을 잡아야 하는 게임이었는데 이를 실패해서, 게임을 하는 과정 및 게임 속 품은 이야기가 재미있게 느껴지지 않았다.\n\nWhisper of the House 는 게임플레이 (짐을 정리하는 과정) 및 스토리 면에서 나 같이 집중력이 적은 사람들이 중간에 게임을 접지 않도록 어느 정도 조치를 취한 모습을 보이는데, 게임플레이 면의 경우 짐을 정리하는 레벨들이 이 게임의 핵심이기는 하지만, 소소하게 숨겨져 있는 퍼즐들을 풀어 나가는 재미 및 숨겨진 물체 / 상호작용들을 찾는 재미가 있었고, 각각의 스테이지가 자신만의 개성을 자랑할 수 있도록 스테이지 별 테마 및 가구들을 다양하게 배치해 두었다. 특히 마음에 들었던 건 해변가에 있는 오두막이었는데, 바다 테마의 벽지와 가구들을 보면서 \"나도 저런 집에 살고 싶다 .... \" 라는 생각이 저절로 들게 되었다. 비록 여러 가지 테마를 배치하기 위해 비현실적인 설정들 - 두 번째 스테이지를 완료하면 마법과 관련된 집 정리 스테이지가 나오기에, 진짜 현실적인 게임을 기대했다면 좀 당황할 수 있다 - 이 들어가 있다는 게 마음에 안 드는 사람들도 있을 것이지만, 개인적으로는 그렇게 마음에 걸리는 특징은 아니었다. 스토리 또한 여러 가지 인물들을 만나고 그들을 도와주는 게 주요 내용이며, 물론 스토리 기반 게임들에 비하면 내용이 많이 부실한 건 사실이지만 그래도 다양한 사연 및 특징을 지닌 인물들을 넣어 두어서, 하나의 사연을 충분히 맛 봤다고 생각하면 또 새로운 스테이지를 던져 주면서 게임의 분위기를 지속적으로 바꾸고 환기한다는 장점이 있다. 특이하게도 게임 내 엔드 컨텐츠는 마을을 탐험하는 게 아니라 내 집을 꾸미는 것 및 모든 가구 / 오브젝트를 찾는 것인데, 후자의 경우는 게임을 진행하다 보면 얻을 수 있는 게임 내 재화를 이용해 뽑기를 하여서 여러 가지 가구들을 모을 수 있고, 생각보다 그 종류가 매우 많아서 모든 가구를 찾는 건 솔직히 말해 이 게임에 애정이 넘치치 않는 이상 적당히 절반 정도만 모으고 그 이상은 손이 가지 않을 것이다. 전자의 경우, 게임을 많이 진행하면 무려 나만의 집을 선물받게 되고 온갖 가구들을 같이 선물로 받는데, 직접 하다가 상자 안 자잘한 가구들이 너무 많아서 중간에 그만두고 얌전히 스토리나 진행하려고 나왔지만, 이런 장르의 게임플레이에 환장하는 사람이라면 몇 시간 정도는 그냥 태울 수 있는 컨텐츠다. 아무튼, Unpacking 과 비교해서 무엇이 더 우위에 있는 게임이라고 말할 수는 없으나, 여러 가지 컨텐츠와 다양한 테마의 가구들을 보여 주어서 Unpacking 을 하며 느꼈던 단조로움을 비슷한 구성의 이 게임에서 덜 느꼈다는 건 마음에 들었다.\n\n사실 이보다 호불호가 더 갈릴 법한 건 첫 번째 문단에서 적은 내용의 후자인데, 놀랍게도 이 게임의 숨겨져 있는 스토리라인은 일상물과는 거리가 좀 먼 스토리라인이며, 이를 해금하기 위해 (엔딩을 보기 위해) 찾아야 하는 물체들 또한 그렇게 평범한 물체들은 아니다. 게임 속 마을을 돌아다니다 보면 + 다른 사람들의 집을 정리하다 보면 무언가 보라색으로 지지직거리면서 왜곡 효과가 들어간 오브젝트들이 보이는데, 이를 여러 번 클릭하면 왜곡 현상을 제거하고, 마을 좌측에 있는 비밀의 공간 위 숫자가 줄어든다. 당연히 과반수 이상의 왜곡된 물체를 찾으면 해당 공간이 열리며 엔딩을 볼 수 있고, 스토리 자체는 사실 좀 뜬금없기는 하지만 이보다 더 처참한 스토리 위주 게임을 봐 온 나로써는 \"뭐 이 정도면 그럭저럭 넘어갈 수 있겠는데?\" 라는 대가리 깨진 생각만 들었다. 비록 아기자기한 일상물 게임을 기대했다면 이렇게 스토리 방향이 미스터리로 틀어진 것에 대해 거부감을 느낄 수 있으나, 오히려 이 특징 때문에 마을 이곳저곳을 뒤지는 동기를 플레이어에게 제공해서 좀 더 몰입감을 높였다는 건 나쁘지 않다고 생각하며, 이 독특한 물체들을 찾는 과정이 너무 난해하지 않아서 외부의 공략 없이 자연스레 엔딩을 보기까지 필요한 수량을 채울 수 있었다. 특히, 이런 물체들로 인해 게임 내 숨겨진 다양한 상호작용을 보는 재미도 있었고 (예를 들어서, 두 번째 스테이지에서 반죽을 오븐에 넣어서 태워먹을 수 있다는 사실을 몰랐는데 공략을 보고 \"아니, 이런 것도 있었어?\" 라는 걸 알게 되었다) 이러한 왜곡된 물체들이 게임의 재미를 깎아먹는 건 아니었다고 생각한다. 특히 제일 귀여웠던 상호작용은 욕조에 고무 오리를 배치한 뒤 눌러보면 머리를 꾹 누르는 애니메이션이 나오는 것이었다. 별 거 아닌데 좌우로 고무 오리가 찌그러지는 게 너무 귀여웠다 ..... \n\n\n결론적으로, 아기자기한 가구들을 정리하는 재미와 나름 넓고 다양한 건물들을 탐방하며 게임 속 숨겨진 물체와 이벤트에 대해 알아가는 재미가 잘 어우러져 있는 잔잔한 캐주얼 장르의 게임이라 추천. 플레이타임의 경우 게임 100% 완료까지 약 6시간이 걸렸는데, 다른 스팀 평가들에 이보다 더 짧은 시간이 찍힌 경우가 많지 않다는 걸 생각하면 최소 플레이타임이 약 5 ~ 6 시간일 것으로 보인다. 가격 대비 플레이타임이 약간 애매하게 느껴질 수도 있으니, 직접 해보고 싶다면 가벼운 할인을 할 때 구매해서 해보는 걸 권장한다.\n\n여담) 스팀 업적의 경우 100% 완료하는 건 1회차 안에 할 수 있으며, 이미 정리를 완료한 집도 다시 들어가 볼 수 있기에 실수로 업적을 놓쳤다고 해도 업적과 관련되어 있는 장소로 다시 들어가는 게 어렵지 않다. 스팀 가이드에도 100% 업적 가이드가 있으니 만약 막힌다면 해당 공략을 참고하다 보면 무난하게 업적을 모두 딸 수 있을 것이다.",

      "review": "Overall Rating: 8.5/10\n\nOkay, firstly I would like to say that I do LOVE this game. It's everything that I found addicting from Unpacking and then some. I love the story and the underlying creepy vibe. It turns a simple cozy, organizing game into an expanded experience. I've played through twice now and am still finding hidden bits. It's the perfect game to load up after a long grueling day, and a great way to unwind. Well worth the few bucks to support an up and coming indie game company. \n\nHOWEVER; there are a couple things that I wish were different. The biggest thing being I wish that there was a way to mass select objects to recycle, rather than having to drag everything one by one. It's tedious and I would rather have a clean inventory to choose from. The way that the item unlocking works makes for many duplicates that just ends up sitting in my inventory taking up space. This is a minor inconvenience and doesn't take away from the overall experience, but I do find myself bored after spending 15 minutes attempting to clean out the inventory. I haven't hit a cap/max in storage (yet), but it's still slightly annoying to sift through even with the storage organization update.\n\nMy other wish for this game is that I wish there were more accessible buildings and stories, but I understand that this could be because it's still a new game and hasn't been fully fleshed out yet. It's such an addictive game and I want to spend hours discovering everything in the world, but it just seems to go really fast. This could very much just be a me issue though... \n\nThis is my first ever steam game review, and I'm hoping that the creators take my recommendation, but I'll still be enjoying this game regardless! If you're into cozy, satisfying, and wholesome games, I highly recommend Whisper of the House. \n\n<3",

      "review": "I rarely write reviews about games, but this one deserves it. My first game of this kind was Unpacking, and it was so much more than what Whisper of the House offers. In Unpacking, I felt connected to the world, like I was uncovering a story through the items themselves. This game has none of that immersion.\n\nThe idea and concept are strong, but the execution fails. The rooms are overcrowded, you can’t not use items, and at no point did I feel any satisfaction while playing. Recently, I tried Hozy’s playtest, and I was blown away—the sound and gameplay were deeply satisfying. In comparison, this game just left me waiting for the boxes to finally be empty. Every time I finished a room, I thought it looked ugly. Not once did I feel proud of what I created.\n\nThe biggest problem is how mismatched the items are to the rooms they’re meant for. It breaks any sense of coherence or achievement. While I do appreciate the art style and the core idea, the game simply doesn’t deliver what this genre requires. It fails to be satisfying, and that’s critical for a game like this.",

The decorating mechanics are deep and enchanting, with freedom of creativity as well as little puzzles to solve if you care to spend long enough digging around in each build. \n\nThe collecting mechanics for furniture and items is intuitive and exciting, each time I unlock something new I can't wait to run back to one of my houses to redecorate around a new theme! The \"jobs\" are all unique and different in their own way too so that each build feels special and fresh, with so many different themes to explore. It feels really special to be able to walk into the shops you've helped design and then buy items from them too. The world feels so full and alive. \n\nThe spooky/mystery undertone catches me off guard sometimes but honestly I would accept more of it, the cosiness of the game with the underlying hauntings is such a fun juxtaposition - I'm not quite finished with the game yet as far as I can tell I still have a few jobs to go - so I'm really excited to see what else there is to discover. I get genuinely a little freaked out at some parts (spoiler) like the spooky letters you get in the mail! But it's delightfully spooky in a sense that I want to receive more.\n\nThe devs also recently included an update that makes the UI of decorating so much easier by having the items easier to find in your storage/catalogue which honestly made it even more charming to play.\n\nThe one criticism I would have is that there's no way to customise your character past the two predetermined options - I would love to be able to wear the clothes that you can unlock or even just change the hair and skin tone would add so much to the game in my opinion!\n\nHowever, that aside, this game is an easy 10/10 and I'm having so much fun with it. I will be devastated when I complete it. It's a gem!",

Si te va el rollo de los juegos tranquilos y creativos, te va a encantar.\n\nBásicamente, tu trabajo es ir a casas de un pueblo a limpiar y decorar. Pero no es solo eso, porque puedes mover y organizar todo como tú quieras. Y no te imaginas la cantidad de muebles y objetos que hay, ¡es una pasada!\n\nLo mejor es que tiene un estilo pixel art súper bonito y es increíblemente relajante. Además, a medida que juegas, vas descubriendo los secretos del pueblo, lo que le da un toque de misterio genial.\n\nEn serio, si buscas un juego para desconectar y crear cosas bonitas, este es. ¡Muy recomendado!",

The cute game design immediately drew me in, and the combination of relaxing music and the gentle weather system makes it the kind of game you can unwind with after a long day. It really scratches that Unpacking itch, but with a touch of mystery layered in to keep things interesting.\r\n\r\nThe recent updates to the furniture UI are a huge improvement — browsing and selecting items feels way more efficient and user friendly now, which makes the whole decorating process even smoother and more enjoyable. The replayability is also surprisingly solid thanks to the daily showrooms, which are perfect for those moments when you just want that quick, satisfying “one room” hit without committing to a full session.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for something wholesome, chill, and a little intriguing, Whisper of the House is absolutely worth your time.",

Mesmo sem ter muito conhecimento de inglês, achei o jogo bem intuitivo — ele dá as pistas certas sem entregar os segredos, o que torna a exploração mais interessante. Tive que voltar algumas vezes em certos pontos pra entender melhor o que fazer, mas isso fez parte da diversão. Em nenhum momento a jogabilidade me frustrou — pelo contrário, me manteve curiosa e envolvida o tempo todo. A ambientação é linda, com um clima fofo e sombrio na medida certa. Me entreteu do começo ao fim.\r\n\r\nDepois da atualização mais recente, a experiência com a decoração melhorou muito. Agora está muito mais fácil localizar os itens, o que é um ponto super positivo pra quem gosta de personalizar o ambiente sem perder tempo procurando as coisas.",

      "review": "Whisper of the House: a cozy pixel escape with a sprinkle of magic\n\nIf you're looking for a game to gently peel your brain out of burnout mode and wrap it in a warm, pixelated hug... this is it.\n\nYou get to unpack, clean, decorate, and vibe your way through charming little houses full of secrets, sparkles, and the occasional magical surprise. Think Unpacking, but with more whimsical lore and the occasional ghost.\n\nThe story is light and easy to follow. No over-complicated timelines or existential dread here. Just cozy mystery with a side of mild enchantment. The gameplay is smooth, intuitive, and blessedly ADHD-friendly. I 100%'d the whole thing in about 6 hours, and not once did my attention decide to yeet itself into the void.\n\nThe pixel art? Adorable.\nThe atmosphere? Relaxing.\nThe soundtrack? Melted into the background like a cup of warm tea and never once annoyed me.\n\nTop moments? The graveyard setting and EinSmart's Secret Lab made me do that little gamer giggle of joy when things are just right.\n\nSo if you’re into games that let you decorate, discover secrets, and unwind without the pressure of combat or cryptic puzzles... this one’s for you.\nWould recommend to anyone who enjoyed Unpacking, adores cute pixel art, or wants a whisper of the supernatural without the threat of possession.\n\nFinal verdict?\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Cozy chaos with a ghostly wink.",

The furniture is SO cute and I like that most of the time you have plenty of choice in how you create the rooms. It encourages exploration/curiosity as well with plenty of achievements to work towards and fun puzzles throughout. I loved Unpacking and this satisfies that same part of my brain that yearns to organize! \n\nA few things though- the story line is extremely disjointed. There are envelopes of special moments but nothing that created an entire package if that makes sense. The translations are kinda loose, sometimes conversations are nonsensical. The UI can confusing at times as well. One of the game tips that showed on a loading screen was to hide the UI when you take photos. I hid the UI and then couldn't figure out how to get it back effectively soft locking me from progressing. Someone in the Discord was kind enough to point out that the ESC key brings the settings back up, but that was not intuitive for me at all. The UI hides itself in camera mode anyway lol\n \nDespite these issues, I have really enjoyed my time with Whisper of the House because the game mechanics and overall pacing were relaxing and satisfying. I don't regret purchasing it, have faith that the developers will continue to improve!",

      "review": "非常喜歡這款遊戲!!!\n\n這遊戲讓我知道原來自己根本不喜歡那些打打殺殺的遊戲\n沒想到光是整理家具就好玩到不行~\n\n遊戲玩法跟unpacking基本一樣，但多了非常非常多互動元素，而且不是箱子可以打開這種簡單的互動\n而是有可能要透過將某些家具組合在一起才能推動隱藏劇情那種。\n\n玩家扮演剛搬進小鎮的搬家工人，透過幫鎮上不同的居民搬家來認識更多人，進而得知這個小鎮不為人知的秘密...\n看得出工作室對這款遊戲的物品文本下了不少功夫，擺放家具的同時也能讀一下物品的敘述來了解居民的人生，\n再加上這個小鎮的居民不全然都是普通居民，還融合了很多奇幻科幻要素，很像走進美國怪奇小說裡的小鎮的感覺，\n世界觀很引人入勝。\n\n玩法上也十分有趣，除了可以幫居民搬家、整理店鋪之外，玩家也有屬於自己的房間，可以透過認識更多居民的家\n或抽盲盒、撿垃圾的機制來獲取各種不同的家具，自由裝飾自己的房間。家具種類也超級多，很可以滿足收集癖的玩家~~",

Playing through this game was a lovely way to unwind, and I would definitely recommend it to those who enjoy solving mysteries involving the supernatural without the content being too scary and remaining pretty lighthearted.",

It has adorable NPC's, a map to explore, and little things to find! Thank you for making this Mac compatible! Every detail is exquisite!\n\nIn response to some reviews - I think not being able to turn the rooms around 360° makes it better. Reminds me of the old Animal Crossing games, and Stardew Valley as well, as it is a pixel game. It has it's own unique charm and identity. Additionally, addressing how some of the items can't be turned all ways, I assume it's because most of them are interactive and have to be front facing out. Neither of these are anything I feel the need to nitpick about, as the game is incredibly generous with how many items they have available! It's phenomenal, down to the tiniest little items to make things look lived in!\n\nPS- the music is so awesome and relaxing!",

      "review": "It's so beautiful and cosy, and I really enjoyed the storyline, but the game itself is broken. Without spoilers, a few of the critical quests make quite literally no sense (no guidance, journal entries or NPC hints). Hours of gameplay can be wasted due to opaque progression and terrible UX.\n\nWith that being said, my version of the game is bugged (I hate \"cheating\" but I was forced to check) as completing MULTIPLE specific quests does not trigger the necessary progression, or does not register as completed, which has ruined the experience. It is possible that the \"impossible\" quests / lack of guidance is also a bug. Maybe I just got unlucky as I would agree with the positive rating if the game worked. I've gotten a refund.\n\nHowever, I feel that it is unacceptable for them to have sold this as a \"finished\" game when several elements are clearly half-baked and buggy. Others in online forums (Reddit etc.) have also reported this issue. I would avoid until the developers patch this, and provide proper guidance in the gameplay if that is not a bug. Overall, I am extremely irritated and disappointed.\n\nPros: beautiful pixel-style art and graphics, fun storyline.\nCons: game-breaking bugs, total lack of guidance in areas, and frustrating UX.\n\nUpdate: I have changed my rating. The latest patch has fixed the bugs, though I stand by what I said about lack of guidance on critical quests. Overall, I enjoyed it.",

There's one level in particular that is particularly memorable.  \n\nThe decorating mechanic is fun.  Sometimes they break it up a little with various cleaning activities.  There's some small puzzles to solve.  I only have minor complaints about the searching and sorting features for storage items.  Otherwise, the core gameplay is solid.  I do wish it was a little longer.\n\nI definitely recommend the game.  It's fun and cozy to play.  It's cool to decorate different set pieces, from houses to bakeries and beyond.",

Took me a good 10-11 hours to finish over the course of a week, playing a few hours a day. Really hope they make more games like this as have been trying to find something to fill the Unpacking-sized hole in my gaming life and this definitely did the trick! 10/10",

How fortunate and I can't believe that this was not in my recommended queue. I find myself wanting to return to this game. It is very relaxing, almost aimless, but the tasks lead the context for the game. You're in a cute town and go around cleaning and organising. Very simple. Very calming and immensely pleasant. I really like this game and recommend it 100% if you like cute, simple cozy games with pretty visuals.",

Também é possível, além de cumprir as quests reorganizando locais a pedido dos NPCs, montar nossas próprias casinhas.\n\nO único detalhe negativo é não ter tradução para PT-BR, mas nada que atrapalhe. No geral, experiência ótima!",

Using them to decorate spaces improves the lives of people all over Whisper. What I love most are the little mysteries that reveal themselves as you play. There are strange corrupted patches, missing people, extra people...a whole town lives and moves around you and as a newcomer you can learn more about it if you care to pay attention to it. I have not yet finished the game but I can't wait to play more. My wishes for this game are to be able to customize my player character, and that the fridge and oven in the bakery would allow you to put items in them. There are other fridges that can do this...why not that one? All in all this game is a little cozy, a little weird, and completely delightful. Pretty good music too!",

      "review": "This game is so addictive! If you like decorating games with a story (like Unpacking - but more so), you'll love this. There's a lot of secrets, things to interact with, collect, and of course decorate. Even after you finish the story, there's still more to collect and decorate with town requests at the board (unlocked as you progress). Thoroughly enjoyed finding all the secrets! \r\n\r\nMy only criticism (which isn't really much of one) is that you can't dress up your character with the clothes and wigs collected. Would also be nice to go to some of the areas that are blocked off or unlock more buildings like the library. Maybe I missed it, or maybe it'll be in a future update/DLC. Either way, the game is still fantastic and worth the price.",

This game is about organizing different homes and business for people around the town you just moved to. The pixel artstyle and lofi-esq music give the game a cozy vibe. There is also a mystery to the town which is slowly revealed as you talk to more people in town and receive newspaper with hints to what is going on. It reminds me of Unpacking but expanded to the city and it's people.",

A jogabilidade é bem fácil, só precisa prestar bastante atenção em alguns detalhes, e as interações com os objetos desbloqueiam momentos incríveis e enriquecem a história, dando profundidade aos personagens. \nE mesmo após finalizar a história principal, ainda há missões para continuar decorando locais específicos, fora a decoração das nossas próprias casas. A pixel art é muito bonita e o catálogo de decoração é bem vasto (só precisa de um pouco de paciência para adquirir tudo), mas acho que poderia haver mais opções de personalização dos objetos, paredes e pisos.\nEu me apaixonei pelo jogo desde a demo e esperei ansiosamente até o lançamento, e após platinar posso dizer que valeu a pena.",

It's a fun cozy story with some interesting elements. You get to design spaces and help out the towns people. It's super relaxing and enjoyable. No horror but there is some super natural stuff. Enough weird things to keep you interested. You can also pet the cats. 10/10 absolutely loved this game and will continue to play it even though I've finished it. I'm hoping there will be a dlc for it in the future.",

The stories are all really well done, and I really loved the one with the scientist and the grandpa, as well as the one with the gang boss leader. The spooks are fun to find and get pretty scary at times (like finding that room in the first mission, or the cemetery tower), but thankfully no jumpscares. Absolutely stellar game that I'm glad to have played and discover all achievements for.\n\nIn the future, I would love to see furniture recoloring options, more spooky anomalies, even more furniture types, and maybe some more achievements to get. Glad to hear that a house purchasing option is in the works soon, so looking forward to that, and hopefully there will be a way to customize and construct/deconstruct room types too!",

You play as a housekeeper who’s new in town, working for a company that helps residents move into their homes and gets local shops set up. Along the way, you’ll be cleaning, organizing, and fixing up the town—everything from tidying up trash to repairing objects that are mysteriously “glitched.”\r\n\r\nWhat really stood out to me is how the game balances cozy, laid-back gameplay with a storyline that hints at something deeper. The town feels warm and inviting, but there’s also this subtle haunted vibe that makes you want to keep exploring and see what’s really going on behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nIt’s the kind of game you can unwind with—whether you’re completing small tasks, wandering the streets, or piecing together the story. If you enjoy cozy sims, light puzzle-solving, and a dash of supernatural mystery, this is a wonderful little gem worth picking up.",

      "review": "A nice quiet cozy game with an enjoyable soundtrack, WOFTH offers an enjoyable story line based around the core mechanic of decorating, sprinkled varying tasks to drive the story, and hidden anomalies/puzzles to solve, this game is short and sweet with an expected endgame/replay. While somewhat repetitive, there's promising room for updates, DLC/expansions, and improvement.\n\nA few points of improvement\n1) furniture rotation - many items are locked to only 2 positions (as noted above, limiting their aesthetic use)\n2) better/more inclusive customization of furniture - very few offer the color change option\n3) better/more wall, floor, and railing options (renovation)\n\nIn the future, it'd be nice to have the ability to chose house layouts or at least move stairs/lofts to create a better sandbox experience. Overall I give this game an 8/10 - it's just the beginning, and I hope to see more!",

You have been invited to become the town’s housekeeper. You will take various jobs helping people unpack in their new homes, organize their businesses, clean up abandoned areas, etc. all while learning their stories and uncovering something mysterious happening within the town. You’ve probably heard Whisper of the House being compared to the game “Unpacking”. Although I agree to some extent, I think that Whisper of the House offers so much more both in terms of gameplay and story. \r\n•\r\nYou’ll enter each house/business and begin unpacking one item at a time. How you organize and decorate those areas is completely up to you. However, you’ll have to complete the goals of each area - that might be making sure the space has been completely cleaned, or certain items align with certain spots, etc. You’ll also solve puzzles to unlock secret rooms or find a rare flower. Whisper of the House offers a variety of things to do, so you never feel bored. There is a linear story to uncover, but after the credits roll, you’ll be able to maintain your role within the town and return to decorating until your heart’s content. \r\n•\r\nI really enjoyed my time playing this game, however, there are a couple of reasons it didn’t get a perfect score. The biggest reason was the ending. The entire game you are uncovering cursed objects and being threatened with creepy notes, but the ending didn’t match that vibe at all. I was hoping for some big plot twist and it just fell flat. The second reason was that there was a lack of direction. Three areas stick out to me in particular, Luna’s house, the construction crane, and the Graveyard (I won’t go into further detail to avoid spoilers). Two of those areas directly impacted the advancement of the story, so not being able to figure out what I was missing became a little frustrating. I did have to resort to their Discord for some assistance. \r\n•\r\nDespite those couple of things, I absolutely loved this game and highly recommend it. If you’d like to watch me play it or help in finding some achievements, I have the entire gameplay posted on my YouTube channel (@SwankyHoneybee).",

Loved all the different styles and was very fun with all the freedom of choice it allows you during decorating. The town mysteries and the residents 'problems' didnt personally interest me, and without that interest the ending just felt confusing and underwhelming. With as big as the town was and all the different items to collect i was really hoping for more main quest progress and themed roomes. You can do custom room on your own but without main goals to work on i guess i finished the game too soon. Great cute fun little game, i just didnt realise how much mystery was involved and hoped for longer gameplay.",

      "review": "[h1]《呓语小镇》：国产惊喜之作[/h1]\n　　作为一名在《Unpacking》刚出的时候就白金的玩家，看到《呓语小镇》的火爆多少还是有些五味杂陈——一方面惊喜于它在《Unpacking》的基础上做出了自己的东西；另一方面又感慨国产独立游戏始终还是无法跳出「copy」的怪圈，或许创意才是咱们目前真正最缺少的东西，而这也是《骰子浪游者》最难能可贵的地方（创新了尖塔like）。\n\n　　简单说说它跟《Unpacking》的区别吧：[b]在核心的「家具放置」环节上不如前者精细；但在局外做了个庞大的任务主线，同时手搓了一座精美小镇、并且在里面塞满了各种交互彩蛋。[/b]\n\n　　在这样的情况下，本作虽然没有像《Unpacking》那样通过关卡的年代来完成场景叙事，不过由于大量NPC的引入完成了出色的群像塑造，在这方面的体验是相当别致的——老实说我蛮喜欢这套主线设计，既能给我们带来更出色的沉浸感与扮演感，又很好地控制了玩家的游玩路径，同时保留了一定自由度，虽然本质是线性推进关卡、不过在小镇里闲逛的时候还是有非常多的惊喜。\n\n　　总之，游戏的场景建模相当精美，在像素作品里我觉得算是不错的，如果再把范围限定到国产那就更优秀了，所以这种画风清新唯美的作品应该在女性市场比较出圈——《Unpacking》便是如此。虽然说同样是家具放置，本作在精细度上不如前者，基本上都是单层空间放置，没有更多的机关交互，并且也没有做区域划分，玩家可以随意对家具进行摆放。\n\n　　另一方面，这种设计也带来更高的自由度，「随心所欲地摆放」并不一定是坏事，至少在《Unpacking》的游玩过程中我常常会对一两个物件找不到“归处”而感到红温，而本作就完全没有这方面的困扰：可以说，家具放置本该如此自由嘛！\n\n　　总的来说，是一款不错的休闲游戏，尤其作品在叙事上还埋藏了非常多的惊喜，小镇里也有丰富的彩蛋等着玩家去挖掘，能光速好评如潮、成为年度小爆款也就不奇怪了。\n[quote]关注[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36224058/]老实人鉴赏家 [/url] \n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/laoshirenLSR]老实人评测[/url]：独立游戏爱好者聚集地，黄油绅士交流中心。 \n不错过游戏的亮点，不放过游戏的槽点，带给玩家最直观的测评感受。[/quote]",

Всё предельно понятно - уборка, распределение вещей по местам либо распаковывать коробки и придумывать новым вещам своё место. \n\nВ некоторых локациях игра сама подсвечивает куда надо поставить определённые вещи, либо если в руках вещь, которая может взаимодействовать с окружением - будет подсвечивать варианты. Например, мусорки в которые надо скидывать весь треш будут подсвечиваться зелёным. \n\nИ тут не без мистики, если от предмета странное свечение и он бликует - значит его тоже надо очистить и он может дать нам какие-либо доп вещи в коллекцию, либо будет какая-то история.. \n\nПодходит игра, мне кажется, всем =) Английский язык тут элементарный, в целом, на некоторых загадках можно использовать гуглпереводчик по фото, если есть сложности. \n\n🟢Скачущее энергопотребление от 9 до 15 Вт на Steam Deck, но стабильные 60 фпс =)\n\n👤Голова трещит, горло полыхает, мозги не работают и игра идеально вписалась в это состояние =)",

I did see the dev say that they plan to update with more stories to add onto this game in the future, so I'm looking forward to that. ^^",

Getting a couple of your own houses to decorate with blind box purchase at stores around town is also great, I just wish you could change wall and floor styles and colour on all rooms in all houses.

That being said I absolutely cannot wait for update, and hope we'll get more nice small stories.\nI'm personally not big on just making 1 room pretty just because, but if this is your things you could spend an exponential time on it.\nMaybe if I have to point out 1 kinda negative point it would be the gatcha system for the object?

      "review": "打完结局感觉游戏的完成度有点又高又低的，本以为背后有一个特别大的秘密，最后掲示出来的结局还说得过去，但也会让人觉得开发组在剧情方面的尝试有点浅尝辄止。这也不算是缺点，如果刻意去做特别庞大复杂的剧情结果拖垮了开发或者让剧情又臭又长并不是一种好事，目前停留在每个故事都简单但温馨的程度其实不错，但如果后续开发dlc或者同类型作品/续作希望开发组能在这方面更进一步。\r\n很多demo里的未开发区域似乎在正式版本里也没有过多拓展，不知道小镇的边界是为了后续开发预留还是单纯的空气墙？希望起码要做个dlc填充一下，目前确实可游玩的主线剧情不算很多，虽然因为物品密度高加上几乎每个物品都有相对应的说明，可能这方面的工作量比玩家实际上体验到的要多，所以我可以接受这个价格，但如果开发组能有后续的更新拓展显然会让游戏性价比方面的争议少很多。\r\n游戏主要玩法应该是收纳+装修，个人感觉收纳是主线，装修算是自选的拓展玩法，显然主线对于游玩时间的支撑比较有限，但装修方面的问题确实是有些多，如果是专门冲着玩装修来的话，可能会觉得限制太多，可选项不够丰富。\r\n开发者虽然做了物品分类但感觉分类做得很混乱，尤其是杂物和装饰两个大类，建议按照常见的装修摆放逻辑添加一些物品标签（比如书籍类物品就打上书籍tag，很多都只有书名，搜索的时候找不全；瓶瓶罐罐类的东西可以加上瓶子标签，调味料加上调味料标签这样）。大部分物品和家装都不能自选颜色，很多东西能不能叠放、并放的判定也比较抽象，也不能调整大小，自由度确实不高，只能说可以玩，但在装修类游戏里不算是很有竞争力。\r\n我个人其实是比起装修更喜欢玩收纳的人，也就是更喜欢直接塞给我一堆东西让我摆放这种玩法，对我来说比给我一个空房间让我随便摆更好，目前游戏的设计上也是收纳比装修更好玩一些，真心希望多加一些收纳关卡，或者给玩家自由装修和收纳两种玩法的可选项（那些自由接取的任务，开发者可以做出对应的模板，将整套物品提供给玩家让玩家自由摆放）。我认为其实呓语小镇确实更适合重点做收纳方向，因为要在装修方面追赶其他装精装修的游戏比较难，但收纳方面就不需要在玩法上丰富那么多的内容，只需要按照目前的模式继续添加故事线、增加可供收纳的房屋即可。\r\n以及，便利店的收纳，那几个不能移动的冰柜能不能设计成可移动的？在被遮挡的情况下很多东西放进去了很难拿出来，很多东西也放不进去，玩的时候真的有点急火攻心了。\r\n虽然游戏的可探索点很多，但变化相对来说少了一些，这些应该依然是开发体量的问题，但还是希望开发者能在这方面多做一些努力。比如增加剧情人物对话内容，增加路边随机npc的对话内容，一些互动后会有反应的物品（比如博物馆门口的长颈鹿雕塑）如果后续没有其他反应，可以删掉互动选项？因为场景可互动物太多了，但变化不大，我垃圾桶就摸不过来了。地图里还有一些没有太多剧情的类似彩蛋的npc，如果能增加一些互动的话会更好，可以让整个小镇更有变化感。主线剧情人物之间也是很少有什么互动，很多地图完成后并没有npc在活动（比如便利店、面包店、酒吧根本没开门啊），就会让人觉得有点缺少生活感（当然可以用主线剧情来解释，但既然主角已经改变了这一切，希望还是有所不同）。黑手那条线感觉也是没有怎么铺开呢，有些可惜，甚至连本人都没有见到。如果去墓地的时候能见到黑手来献花就会觉得更有实感。\r\n像现在这样除了偶尔会下雨并没有什么时间变化，是不是在游戏内能引入节庆系统？当然因为游戏时间过得太快，很容易不小心跳过节庆，所以也可以通过锁定或者强制进入或者延长节日周期这样的方式来规避这个问题，节庆主题可以用来做一些支线剧情将主线人物聚在一起，或者出一些节日主题的家装，很适合用来丰富内容。考虑到结局的剧情，也可以是在完成主线后，可以由主角来操控时间变化，主动进入节庆或者制造节庆\r\n",

The story doesn't have the same emotional depth, it's more about decoration, organization and uncovering the weird mysteries from the town.\n\nI finished the game so I obviously enjoyed (some of) it, but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. And the fact that I had to get so many achievements to be able to finish the story also left a sour taste.\n\nDue to the cute pixel art, many might think this is a family-friendly game, [b]but that is NOT the case[/b]. There are some disturbing elements with the \"secrets\" within the game, for example as the protagonist you get some threatening letters, and in one of the first quests it is implied that [spoiler]the owner's dog is being drugged by a person secretly hiding in the house[/spoiler]. I don't think this is highlighted enough in the Steam page so I'm hoping this review will be helpful for awareness.\n\nIn general I liked the quests, but for a decoration game, it was really frustrating that the only house I could customize the walls and flooring was the first one you move in to, which is also the smallest. (apart from houses from quests)\n\nIn summary, this game did not live up to my expectations.",

But it also has purpose and a story, along with really cool puzzles and city lore. You can play this game just doing the design and bare minimum, or you can choose to delve deeper into the city's secrets. Only issue I have is I wish there were a customization option for the character, and I wish you could have more control over coloring certain items. But theses are small issues that I'm sure will eventually be put in regardless (or maybe I havent gotten to that point yet)",

I think its also an excellent price for the amount of playtime. Looking forward to coming back whenever I get that itch to organize cute stuff. Having lots of fun!",

It would be nice to get a little mail that tells you that the quests are done and you have to look around for the rest or something.\n\nPlayed around 7 hours to get all the achievements. It's was not too hard to get them and sometimes I needed to look up how to get it.\n\nOverall it's a nice game\nIf you liked unpacking and want a game like that with more things to do, then this game is for you. \n",

I was looking for something with zero combat, zero complex puzzles, and 100% vibes. Let me tell you, for the first hour or so, this game delivered that in spades.\r\n\r\nRight from the start, the graphics are just stunning. We're not talking hyper-realistic, next-gen craziness, but a beautiful, painterly art style that feels like stepping into a living watercolor. The house you explore is drenched in the golden hour glow of a late afternoon sun. You can see dust motes dancing in the light streaming through the bay windows, and the wood grain on the floors looks so detailed you can almost feel it. The textures on the plush armchairs, the worn leather of old books, the way the light catches the porcelain of a teacup—it’s all incredibly thoughtful and immersive. It’s the kind of game you play just to be in that space.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is simple: you just wander through this empty, gorgeous house and interact with things. You can water the plants on the windowsill, which then seem to perk up and glow a little. You can put a record on the vintage player and this wonderfully soft, lo-fi soundtrack kicks in. It’s meditative. There’s no goal, no timer. You’re just… existing in this peaceful, quiet space. It was the perfect digital detox.\r\n\r\n If you're looking for a truly unique and atmospheric game that masterfully plays with tone, you have to try this",

I have been looking forward to this game as a narrative game with a mechanic similar to Unpacking. However, the game actually plays half sandbox, half narrative. The narrative started off strong, but gets much weaker throughout the game - most of the npcs do not engage with you or have a further story after your initial task with them, and after the final narrative task, it feels like the game abruptly ends with no great conclusion. I like the idea of spooky elements in the game, but all it amounts to is clicking on certain items and there wasn't enough incentive for me to complete the museum. I'm also not a fan of the gacha/gambling system to unlock new furniture/items - I would rather be able to buy certain items with the vouchers.\n\nI also played the game on my Steam Deck, which I don't recommend. It's technically playable but I got soft locked a few times and had some issues not unique to the deck - the search function for furniture is awful and the decoration wall/floor panel doesn't go away unless you leave the room and come back in.\n\nI love the idea of this game, but it just feels unfinished and underdeveloped, and I sadly don't recommend it in its current state.",

I need something with clear goals to keep me engaged and enjoying the experience. Whisper of the House grabbed me instantly, it had me hooked within those first 10 minutes, and now I’m intentionally taking my time with it because I don’t want it to end too quickly :’)\n\nThis is hands down my Cozy Game of the Year. It’s simple yet captivating, cozy but with just the right amount of haunting mystery as you try to piece everything together. I haven’t finished it yet, but I’m so excited to uncover the truth behind the [spoiler] glitching items [/spoiler].\n\nI really hope the developers continue to expand this gem. It’s so underrated, and more people deserve to enjoy it the way I have <3",

For me, it felt more Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibes because of the open world, free style decorations, and NPC interactions. \"BUT\" it's very short and the story is not as fleshed out which left me quite disappointed. In fact, I didn't even realize I finished the story part of the game and was left so confused.\n\nI just wish there was more but I don't want it to be in paid DLC form. Instead I wish they will update the game itself. Or is that too much to ask for?\n\nHowever, I do like the decorating part. It's very cute and I easily got lost into decorating mode. I'm not done with all the rooms yet so I'll be going back into it once I'm done posting my review.\n\nAnd the most important thing in the game is you can pet the CAT!\n\nEDIT: I've played for additional more hours now and at the moment, I still can't recommend it. I wish there were more features and functions. It's still too early for a DLC so I wish they improve the game instead.\n\nAlso, I wish they improve the items filtering cause it takes me minutes to find an item that I need. Shops needs to have search functions as well for easier shopping.",

Most of what is here is pilfered from other, better videogames, reused without intention or understanding. Its primary Housekeeping activity is a hollow imitator of Unpacking, devoid of heart and creativity. Its vague, adventure-style puzzles should be its most interesting feature, but the player character is given no compelling reason to seek them out. I’m determined to compliment at least one thing about Whisper of the House, and here it is: Its pixel art graphics are wonderful. The sheer number of objects available to place in houses feels like where the most care went into this videogame’s creation. A videogame needs to do more than look nice to be appealing. At this, Whisper of the House fails in every corner of its beautiful city.",

      "review": "A game about helping sort their house/business, but with a mystery looming in the background. It looks beautiful, and it is so much fun to uncover more and more. No missable achievements and completion takes around 7 hours. \n\n[b]Approximate time to 100%:[/b] Around 7 hours\n[b]Estimated achievement difficulty:[/b] 1/10\n[b]Minimum number of playthroughs needed:[/b] 1\n[b]Is there a good guide available:[/b] Yes, I used this one: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3556988145\n[b]Multiplayer achievements:[/b] No\n[b]Missable achievements:[/b] No, you can return to the town after the ending\n[b]Grinding Achievements:[/b] No\n[b]DLC-Only achievements:[/b] No\n[b]Speedrun achievements:[/b] No\n[b]Time-gated achievements:[/b] No\n[b]RNG-achievements:[/b] A tiny bit, the achievement \"Failed to Take in\" requires some luck, but buy the big box with more items to go faster, and maybe save before purchasing the items in case you don't get it. I'm unsure if that is even possible. I still had a lot of credits when I got it.\n[b]Does difficulty affect achievements:[/b] No difficulty option, you can use the in-game hints during missions\n[b]Unobtainable/glitched achievements:[/b] No\n[b]Gamepad or mouse and keyboard:[/b] Mouse and Keyboard\n\nAs someone who enjoyed Unpacking but wished it told a little bit more of a story, this one fills that gap. I was already blown away by how gorgeous the game looks, but having the unpacking gameplay combined with a mystery to solve and helping people sort/clean their properties was so much fun! I also love that we have a robot helper. Please don't ask how the box he is holding contains all those items, as that is a mystery in itself. But your robot buddy is so cute! \n\nWhat is also nice is that most of the time, you have a choice between properties to go for; in the end, you'll do them all, but it is nice that the game gives you the option of which one you want to do next. Walking around the town to find weird stuff is also so much fun. Later on, you'll unlock a bus pass so you don't have to walk all the way, but I kinda never used it, as I even enjoyed the time strolling through town, and the city isn't so big that it takes a long time.\n\nThere are a few missions where some items have a fixed spot, but most of the missions you're totally free to place items wherever you want. Most people who enjoy this type of game would like to organize the items, and that is totally possible, but there isn't a \"wrong\" spot for an item. You have a lot of freedom. There are also side objectives and dailies, which offer even more freedom to design the house however you want. However, those are optional and not required for the achievements.\n\nSpeaking about the achievements, none of them are missable. There are a lot tied to the missions, but there are always secrets within the missions and secrets to find in the town. They aren't missable because you can continually re-enter a building and change things around, or research through them again. What may not be clear from the start is that if you see a glitched item, keep clicking on it with the right mouse button until it is no longer glitching. You'll also unlock an achievement at that point. \n\nAfter going through the ending, you get back into town and can still enter houses. Playing through it yourself first and then looking up solutions to things you couldn't find is a valid strategy and highly recommended. It's just so much fun figuring it out by yourself! \n\nI give Whisper of the House 4.5 out of 5 stars. \n\n\n[code]Do you enjoy games that don't have missable achievements?

      "review": "Spielzeit: 25+ Stunden\nEmpfohlen: Ja!\n\nWhisper of Heart ist ein charmantes und entspanntes Aufbau- und Entdeckungsspiel, in dem du eine liebevoll gestaltete Stadt wieder auf Vordermann bringst – Zimmer für Zimmer und Straße für Straße. In einer fantasievollen, leicht verwunschenen Welt übernimmst du die Rolle einer stillen Heldin, die nicht nur Räume dekoriert, sondern auch Geheimnisse aufdeckt und das Herz der Stadt Stück für Stück wieder zum Leben erweckt.\n\nBesonders gut hat mir der unglaublich liebevoll gestaltete Stil gefallen. Die Welt wirkt wie ein detailverliebtes Wimmelbild: In jedem Raum gibt es unzählige kleine Gegenstände zu entdecken, die nicht nur hübsch aussehen, sondern auch mit viel Sorgfalt in die Welt eingebettet sind. Das Einrichten der verschiedenen Zimmer und Wohnungen macht richtig Spaß und es gibt immer neue Möbel, Dekorationen und Accessoires an den zahlreichen Ständen in der Stadt zu kaufen. Jede Ecke lädt zum Stöbern und Gestalten ein.\n\nBesonders motivierend sind die versteckten Anomalien, die überall in der Spielwelt zu finden sind. Wer sich die Mühe macht, sie alle aufzuspüren, wird am Ende im Stadtmuseum mit einer besonderen Überraschung belohnt – ein schöner Anreiz für alle, die gerne alles erkunden.\n\nAuch das Durchstreifen der wuselig-lebendigen Stadt macht Freude: Hydranten reparieren, Schrott wegräumen, neue Wege freischalten – es gibt immer etwas zu tun, ohne dass es je stressig wirkt.\n\nEin echtes Highlight sind die kleinen Geschichten, die in den Levels versteckt sind. Jede Wohnung erzählt ihre eigene Mini-Story: von der gestressten Bäckerin, die ihren ersten eigenen Laden eröffnet, über eine Zeitreisemaschine im Keller bis hin zu einer geheimnisvollen Magierin, die ein Portal zu einer anderen Welt im Dachgeschoss hütet. Diese liebevoll erzählten Geschichten sind fantasievoll, überraschend und machen die Welt noch lebendiger.\n\nFazit:\n„Whisper of the Heart” ist kein hektisches, sondern ein wunderschönes Spiel. Es lädt zum Träumen, Entdecken und Gestalten ein. Wer Spiele wie Unpacking, Spiritfarer oder A Little to the Left mag, wird sich hier sofort zu Hause fühlen. Absolut empfehlenswert!",

There are also a lot of fun hidden areas and mysteries. The pixel art and art-style are very well done and there are a ton of different objects to interact with. Music is mostly chill, some of the tracks do stand out.\n\nThere are a few odd things about the story and some of the individual characters that maybe are a little hard to understand, but I love the overall strange feeling the world has.

I particularly love it when I help neighbours to clean their houses and along the way, there are hidden stories/clues that can be discovered. IMO, that's the best part of this game.\n\nOnce I start playing it, it's kind of hard to stop because it can be addictive as well! \nSo far, I enjoy it!",

I love organizing/decorating and I love mysteries, so this game is a perfect mix of the two. \r\nI think the only negative I have at the moment are that you can't rotate the room to see it from all angles.\r\nI haven't finished the game yet, but I would still highly recommend it to players who like games like Unpacking.",

I loved interacting with the NPC's stories; those were fun little tidbits of a life that I got to experience and make changes to, but the overall story? What is going on devs :)\r\n\r\nSo 9/10 for me. Maybe the story makes more sense in the original language or maybe I just missed so many social cues as to what was going on but it truly did not tie together for me. \r\n\r\nI also wish that when you talked to the NPCs they would have different replies about how you helped them. But it seems that most of the thought for the game went into the designing aspect which honestly, zero complaints there. \r\n\r\n",

The world is beautiful, love the art style, the mechanics of unboxing and decorating are satisfying, the mysterious storyline is intriguing and the overall attention to details is great.\n\nBut that also bring me to the cons: Storyline is short and sometimes half baked, it took me \"only\" 8 hours to finish; instead of a satisfying ending it was kinda abrupt, I was longing to more.\n\nWhenever you're decorating a home for someone else you have \"Infinite\" inventory of the items you have collected so far, which is really great. Yet when you're decorating one of your own homes the inventory is really limited, you have to grind to get everything. I guess you could see this as a pro or con, whatever your playstyle is, but for me personally this a a con. \nWhy should I grind for getting items I already have unlocked? I have to spam the buy button in the shop to get every item *again*.\n\nNevertheless this game is only 14 eur and just released, I'm hoping the devs will add kore content or dlc, the baseline is great",

Very easy to play, moving items and turning them around etc. Completely beginner friendly. \nDesigning houses and helping the town folks was amazing and we never get tired; and the little mystery in the game adds more to our curiosity. The town is also very pretty and alive... \nThe game is simple but complex at its core and i loved it so much.\n\nIn one word: extraordinary. \n",

      "review": "If you loved unpacking but got so sad that it ended too quickly and just very limited, then this game is for you. It's a major \"upgraded\" version. I liked the game so much. My favorite was the sorting game play for a convenience store. Hopefully they add more of this into the game. You can play it with nothing in mind while still not feeling like a lonely game because there are interaction with cats and people. Plus the cars. The game still has a lot of potentials. There are still other side of the map that hopefully gets unlocked/built. I hope they won't stop with updating this game. I reached the game's end credits and still a lot of things that you can do after. The game is also generous with vouchers that you can buy for furniture and stuffs. I hope they won't get greedy with this. \n\nSo far, these are only the few things I can think of that should be fixed/added:\n- small items even some books, cds, are hard to put upright especially in a shelf's end and under drawer.\n- some furniture are not able to rotate all the way. \n- i hope they open up all the store/buildings in the current map for more things to do. \n- no dashboard of your ongoing tasks or lists on the UI dashboard. \n- maybe they can remove the control buttons guide on the upper left and change it with something else handy.",

      "review": "《呓语小镇》是一款一款轻松治愈的装修收纳游戏。在游戏中玩家将作为一位受邀来到小镇的家政工，通过接收居民的各种委托，例如搬入新居、收拾房间、打扫卫生、筹备新店、整理遗物……甚至找猫猫等各类任务，获取相应的报酬，并使用这些报酬去获取属于自己的各式各样的家具，装修属于自己的房子。但在帮别人打理生活的同时，你可能会无意间改变他们的故事走向，也会逐渐察觉这个小镇的不同寻常之处……\n\n游戏有着独特的美术风格，加上其自由的装修系统和舒缓的节奏，很自然的营造出了一种轻松温暖的氛围。本作中最突出的特点就游戏中那种像素风所营造出的极具吸引力的美术。这种像素美术风格简约却不失精细，场景与家具的设计充满细节，营造出了浓厚的居家感和治愈氛围。甚至同一件家具的不同摆放方式，互动都给玩家一个优秀的反馈。游戏的自由度高，玩家可以随心所欲地搭配家具，甚至调动原本房间中已存在的各种东西，这种自由度不仅能满足游戏中委托任务的要求，也能让玩家的艺术细胞在游戏中充分发挥，尤其是每次完成别人的委托获得报酬再抽出新的家具后，将这些新的家具用来装饰自己的小屋，看着自己的小房子一步步变得更加漂亮，心里充满了成就感。\n\n游戏玩法上，《呓语小镇》的主要玩法就是是帮助小镇中居民摆放物品。具体玩法就是玩家将一件件物品从机器人助手的纸箱中逐一取出，然后在房间那有限的空间内进行合理布置。亲手把混乱的房间收拾得整整齐齐，体验到治愈又细腻的家政过程。床头的茶杯、窗边的绿植、积灰的信件，都能在你手里找到“家”的感觉。多种收纳玩法，让你在打扫灰尘、归置物品之间，感受每一次整理背后的生活痕迹。但这种游戏玩法终究不适合所有人，若是可以享受这种赛博家务的快乐还好，要是你是个急性子那可能只能体会到坐牢的体验。\n\n此外，游戏中还有着许多可以进行交互的家具。你可能会忍不住按一下那台复古的留声机、捏捏浴缸边的小黄鸭、偷偷抽一张纸巾。有的抽屉像在邀请你打开，有的灯开关之间变换完全不同的光影……且在这些互动中玩家还能逐渐发现小镇中居民内心的困扰与心愿——有人在花园里种出了秘密，有人在病房里留着发黄的旧照片，有人守着一间没人使用的炼金工坊。你会在细节中收集线索，把那些未曾说出口的回忆与秘密，拼成一条交织着谜团与情感的完整故事。并逐渐发现小镇中隐藏的东西。\n\n总体而言，《呓语小镇》是一款优点与缺点都相当鲜明的游戏。它在美术、音乐和装修自由度方面的表现可圈可点，适合喜爱像素风格、享受收纳布置、寻求放松体验的玩家。然而，相比较游戏的定价，游戏的内容量显得不是那么的充足，若是只玩一遍可能6-8小时就足以全部游玩。如果你能接受其较为缓慢的节奏和只注重装饰的游戏体验，那么本作可以为你带来一段温馨时光。\n[quote]欢迎关注我们的鉴赏家:[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35402982/]走心评测[/url] ←遵从内心，写出真实感受\n欢迎加入我们Steam组:[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ZXPC]走心评测[/url]←点击加入，一起探索游戏的乐趣\n喜欢这篇评论，也麻烦点个赞，让更多人能够看到！[/quote]\n\n",

      "review": "《呓语小镇》一款国产的像素风装修游戏，游戏主打轻松休闲治愈，游戏的名字让我联想起MC的方块小镇mod，两者其实都有些异曲同工之处，同样是需要根据自己的创意，将公寓或者整个小镇装修一遍，但《呓语小镇》除了装修外，还有更多可玩的内容等待玩家去挖掘。\n\n[h2] 可以来DIY设计的小镇 [/h2]\n市面上是有不少这种类似于装修模拟器的游戏，他们从细节和工序多方面还原现实，而《呓语小镇》与其说是装修，其实更像是让你作为室内设计师去为顾客设计、改造、布置这些生活中乱七八糟的家具，相信在现实生活中有不少同学的房间可能因为各种原因乱糟糟的，如果你想在一个游戏中可以亲自DIY房间布局，那么《呓语小镇》就能做到。\n\n你可能会问，这个游戏只能装修吗？然而并不是，在这里做委托只是你的工作，你工作后会有报酬，拿到丰富的报酬后你可以抽奖、买家居设备、装修你的房子，而玩家可不止能获得一个房子，甚至还有独栋别墅，而游戏中还有各种离奇丰富的支线小剧情，讲述着小镇的秘密和每一个居民的故事。\n\n[h2] 魔法世界？科学世界？ [/h2]\n而《呓语小镇》名字中的“呓语”在现在的网络用语中有些克苏鲁或魔法的味道，没错这其实就是一个魔幻小镇，魔法与未来高科技并存的地方，你可以看到有炼金魔法的公寓、神秘海洋生物的秘密基地、制造出穿越时空的科学家。\n\n说到这个科学家在游戏中有些小插曲，因为小时候爷爷在打扫房屋时候摔伤不幸去世，科学家为了拯救爷爷研发出了时空穿梭机，让主角回到过去帮助爷爷打扫房屋，当玩家回到过去的时候，就已经改变了许多，比如拯救了爷爷也让科学家不再浑浑噩噩的生活、种下了本该枯萎的树苗、间接的还让机器人马克研发成功，如果玩家能够注意到，在改变前机器人马克还是和以前一样的铁盒子，改变后在地下室出现一代二代三代研究失败的铁盒子，可以说制作组的心思是真的细腻。\n\n到这里不知不觉的发现，《呓语小镇》其实并不简单，他和《星露谷物语》一样，在这个小镇上，每个NPC都有自己的生活和故事，同样的主角是新入住的居民，小镇的居民会给主角各种委托，在不经意间渐渐的影响到小镇每一个人的生活足迹，而每一个小镇，背后都有自己的故事和秘密。\n\n[h2] 丰富的装修内容 [/h2]\n说回装修才是《呓语小镇》最大的卖点，[b] “游戏拥有1800 多件家具、10 余种可装修户型” [/b]，我粗略计算了下就单单是书就有250+种、家具300+种、灯100+种、装饰350+种，也就是说每一个类型都有许多同种可以替换选择，有海洋风格、音乐风格、电竞风格、中式风格、猫猫风格、霓虹风格等等。\n\n游戏中居民给我们的委托除了装修外，还有找猫猫、打扫卫生、整理家务…甚至还有帮派的遗物整理，当然我们的委托地点不仅仅只是公寓，还有酒馆、花店、墓地、烘焙房、便利店地下室等等各种场景，真的非常丰富，有时候甚至会带有些解谜的味道，比如恐怖的墓地塔楼。\n\n《呓语小镇》还做了非常多的互动，譬如可以翻垃圾桶找到些乱七八糟的东西；为一些带有“呓语诅咒”的物品驱魔；乐器、设备、家具的交互正反馈等等，当你完成委托后，委托人还会贴心为你送上精心包装的礼物，往往大多数都是黑胶唱片，当然如果你有唱片机那么这些黑胶是可以播放的。\n\n[h2] 结语 [/h2]\n当然要说这个游戏有没有什么问题，那就是流程比较的短，冲着全成就估摸就是十来个小时的流程，游戏设计的成就非常的好玩，而且游戏中有许多藏彩蛋的地方，有时候在意想不到的地方互动制作组总能给你正反馈会应。\n\n但我本以为作为“小镇”应该内容更丰富些，只是有些许的遗憾，而且在设备适配、摆放角度不够自由、房屋布局规划欠缺等体验问题也是玩家所关心的，而且制作组在8.29的更新公告中也表面：“[b] 向大家征集希望在小镇里玩到的内容。你们的想法将成为我们未来更新的灵感来源……发售不是终点，小镇的建设才刚刚起步 [/b]”，也非常期待后续游戏的更新内容，《呓语小镇》瑕不掩瑜，目前游戏的内容值得推荐。\n\n[quote]关注「 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44066492//]来者不拒鉴游组」\n[/url] [/quote]\n[u][b] 做最真实的评测，用心为玩家推荐 [/b][/u]",

      "review": "Even with my review, I thoroughly have enjoyed this game. It is quite simply an overarching mix between Unpacking, the Animal Crossing Happy Homes DLC, and it's own thing entirely. My major issues stem from the fact that the game barely teaches you how to play outside of the basic click and drag items function, as well as the lack of room interaction. I've not had the game explain to me anything about how to get more items, anything about its apparent cleaning of the city, it's scavenging mechanic, or anything really. My other major issue is it's lack of room storage. You're given food items, small bits and bobs, clothing, etc, yet nowhere to place them. For the majority of the game you have no closets, drawers, fridges, nothing. Nothing to open or store things in. This to me is extremely essential to a storage and decor game like this. Hopefully this can be changed in the future, as the game has a sort of professional class that is hard to find nowadays; that is to say it can definitely hold its own. I hope to be able to change this someday, either way thank you for the fun I did have, and heres to hopefully having more in the future.",

I bought this game on a whim and I wasn't disappointed. There are a few things that could be expanded on as others have mentioned, but I'm looking forward to how the devs will add more, and they already have added new features since last I played.",

      "review": "[h1]呓语小镇？还是闹鬼小镇？[/h1]\n家政爱好者的福音来了！还记得21年上线的unpacking吧，以装修各类房屋为核心玩法，同时逐步了解行李主人的人生。而最近上线的这款《呓语小镇》相当于是unpacking plus版，虽然也是以房间装修为主要玩法，但是游戏内核却又不止家政。游戏制作精良，steam96%的好评如潮也足以见得玩家对本作持以极高的评价。\n\n[h3]精致的像素画风[/h3]\n游戏最吸引我的一点就是精致的游戏画风了，虽说以往的像素风游戏都是低成本、复古风的代名词，但是呓语小镇给人的第一印象却是可爱与灵动，就像前些天刚刚发售的《爱氏物语》，谁说像素风不能精致？像素风照样可以从画面上给人眼前一亮的感觉。游戏虽然使用像素风展示，但该有的细节却一点都没少，大量可互动的NPC、有倒影的水面、经常漏水的消防栓、或者是随处可翻的垃圾桶等等等等\n\n[h3]我是一个家政工[/h3]\n在游戏内，我们会接受小镇镇民的委托来帮他们摆放家具，采购家具不是我们的任务，我们的任务就是将合适的家具摆放到合适的位置，放支架时的声音也特别解压，最后经过我们的努力营造出一个温馨的小家，拍完照提交给委托人，心里也是成就感满满。我们也可以和镇民交朋友，有时他们还会给你介绍新顾客或者说是给你送礼物什么的。装修范围不限于普通房间，还有电音馆、面包房、药剂房、海景房等等，每个房间都有属于自己风格的轻音乐，确实是相当解压了。游戏实打实的给了我们一个小镇，我们可以在小镇上与NPC交流、打扫路上的垃圾或者说是撸猫。\n\n[h3]表面温馨的小镇却暗藏玄机[/h3]\n有时我们在小镇闲逛的时候会发现一些比较奇怪的事物，他们就像本不该存在在小镇上一样，闪烁着诡异的光芒，吸引着我们去点他，当我们多次点击击破该异像之后，他们就会像是被收容一样出现在镇中心的一个金字塔博物馆里，每解决一处异像金字塔上的数字就会减一，博物馆里的展品也就越来越丰富。有时我们会收到一些诡异的信件，在镇上找到一些诡异的线索，或者在镇民口中听到一些奇怪的事情，我们通过这些异像就能够慢慢的总结出隐藏在这座光鲜小镇背后的故事。\n\n[h3]装饰自己的理想小屋[/h3]\n在游戏中，除了开局游戏给的那些家具之外，帮助镇民完成任务，镇民们也会给我们一些玩偶或者光碟之类的装饰品，除此之外，在小镇上我们很容易找到书店、家具店、植物店等店铺，可以使用我们手中的券进行抽取，当时手中有4000的券，一抽10券，10抽100券，光抽都给我抽爽了，最后把商店的家具集齐也是很有成就感。\n\n[h2]总结[/h2]\n呓语小镇是一款画风精美，故事丰富，玩法有趣的一款休闲向游戏。如果steam的大作玩够了，电子阳痿了，不妨换换视野，看看这些小众精品独游，或许会让你眼前一亮。玩这类游戏你必须有足够的耐心，如果没有耐心的话，可能玩着玩着就睡着了，那么这款游戏或许并不适合你。但如果你热衷于这种慢节奏的游戏，那么这款游戏一定会为你带来新奇的体验。\n[quote]欢迎前来关注「 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45353266/]\n𝗞𝗼𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗮𝗼🍁」\n[/url]\n[u][b] 采撷旅途之叶，铭刻生命之诗[/b][/u][/quote]",

      "review": "Very sweet game, takes the idea of Unpacking and really tests what you can do with this sort of environmental storytelling! I do agree with some reviews that the ending of the story is a little anticlimactic, but I will also say that it makes up for the short length and conclusion with several sections that really hit me in the feels. I wasn't expecting to tear up during some of these stages, and to me, that marks this game as being able to emotionally connect with the player in a way not many games can.\r\n\r\nI've heard that past previews of the game were quite different to what the game is right now, so do bear that in mind when reading other reviews and such. I do want to mention for the devs that more keybind options would be really great, especially for controllers! I would very much like to separate the interact and rotate functions (which are currently both bound to the B button on on xbox controller). It would also be great to see more quality of life functions like being able to empty an entire container or immediately put items into storage in your own home, as it can be pretty time-consuming to manually pick up small items one by one and move them.\r\n\r\nTLDR; Lovely storytelling with very special moments, even though the end falls a little flat. Could use some QOL updates, but otherwise, a fairly short cozy game.",

I liked the puzzles. I liked the cleaning and decorating (tho by the end I had way too many credits and too many houses for my puny brain to decorate before the end of the story). \r\nMy only complaint is I wanted more, more rooms to decorate that weren't the board missions (I found those a bit confusing, I needed a way to recheck what the person I was designing for wanted), more mysteries to solve and puzzles to puzzle out. Which I think is a great problem to have honestly.\r\nHighly recommend, very worth the price, you will enjoy. ;)",

It could still improve in a lot of ways: the items could be named while you hover or click on them, sometimes you can rotate items 360 degrees, some items only 180, items can't be put down on the floor (temporarily, like in Unpacked), etc. It would be nice to be able to copy and save walls and flooring styles as well.

Genuinely charming and fun to play! The main story does only contain about 8-10 hrs of gameplay. However, the same can be said for House Flipper, which occupies a similar niche and has become one of my most-played/replayed games.\r\n\r\nEasy recommendation for fans of goal-oriented organization like Unpacking, fans of sandbox-style decorating games like Tiny Glade or MakeRoom, and cozy gamers broadly.\r\n\r\nI love it, I hope to see more from this game and/or this team in the future!",

      "review": "个人最喜欢爷爷奶奶两关，和祖辈一起生活过，所以特别能共情爷爷充满生活痕迹的老屋。奶奶也去世了，所以在病房整理白老太的遗物时总是忍不住塞了又塞，将一件件遗物扔在垃圾箱好像抹掉一个人的生活痕迹一样残忍。为逝者“搬家”不是拿出，而是收回，我对着阳光洒落的病床默默发呆了好久。小镇其实保留了微恐元素，只是个人觉得或许情感更具有打动人心的力量，呓语小镇为“装修”赋予了独特的意义，我也从未在其他游戏中只因装修而获得如此复杂的情绪，大多数装修似乎只是游玩游戏本体附赠的一项功能。\n      （unpacking除外，致敬unpacking）\n      作为一名从内测玩家，我见证了小镇的一路成长。开发者团队会倾听每一条意见，呼声大的第二天甚至当晚就会改好，重新翻看demo时期的玩家反馈表，基本上80%的内容已被满足。其实大家常说的那几点他们都有在改了，只不过一只手数的过来的小工作室出效果比较慢，还请大家耐心等待。虽然呓语小镇还不够成熟，但发售只是一个开始，家具量这些不是一朝一夕就能饱和的，小镇未来还有很长的路，请元气弹工作室一定一定要好好走下去。\n---------------以下涉及结局剧透------------------\n[spoiler]另外关于结局的解析，我一开始也以为博物馆的档案内容是旧版本的废稿。其实不然，按照官方的说法，是玩家的到来改变了整个小镇的走向，档案只是玩家没来之前角色的既定结局，结合外星人的那段话就很好理解了。\n（虽然这个结局真的有点点诡异，建议改成第一次进博物馆，看到旧版本档案→和外星人对话→走出房间，档案被改写，这样就好理解多了）[/spoiler]",

There's an underlying story line and multiple side quests that makes the game feel less monotonous. Every house has its own theme and palette.

The game environment is interactive and engaging, there's a lot of room for creativity outside of the games mystery with multiple properties to decorate with a very large library of items to collect and the puzzles are challenging but not difficult. Although I know the game is new, I do hope there is more content added - it has such a comforting vibe it's a shame its such a short game, the story was fun but that too was very short winded but i'd imagine in future more depth will be added (or at least that's what im hoping). Overall super cute game, i'd definitely recommend to players looking for something to just delve into for a few hours!",

If you rush through it and slap down whatever furniture you find then yes, you'll get through it quickly. But if you play it for all it's worth, including exploring the town, meeting characters, finding secrets, completing each job to 100%, you'll end up like me. It starts out playing a bit like Unpacking, placing furniture in a neat and tidy way. Then the story begins and you find yourself searching for hidden clues and secrets, finding hidden rooms and solving mysteries. There's even jobs where you can design your own room based on a clients needs. \r\n\r\nThe art is top notch, and for someone with the eyesight of a bat, I'm incredibly grateful that hovering over each item gives it a description so I'm not staring at pixels unsure of what it is. The story is fun, the decorations are adorable and I love the diversity of jobs given. Top notch game.",

There is an over world tacked on for no reason, if the game was strictly just unpacking boxes and placing furniture it would have been amazing. \n\nSome of the levels are super fun like the alchemy lab but most are pretty boring. There is a lot less polish in placing items than unpacking, I can't quite put my finger on it but it just feels way clunkier placing everything. \n\nPlus the game is super short, I did pretty much everything besides decorating my house in around four hours. It is not worth the money imo, if it was $5 then yeah.\n\n5/10",

      "review": "Whisper Town invites you into a cozy, heartwarming world where decorating, organizing, and uncovering little stories come together in a delightful experience. Taking on the role of the town’s versatile housekeeper, you’ll dive into a variety of charming and quirky tasks. From moving into new homes and tidying up cluttered spaces to setting up fresh shops, sorting through cherished keepsakes, and even tracking down elusive cats, every task offers a sense of purpose and reward. Completing these jobs grants you new furniture and decorative items, giving you the freedom to create a space that truly reflects your style and personality.\n\nAs you help the townsfolk bring order to their lives, you’ll begin to notice that your efforts do more than just tidy rooms—they gently influence the lives and stories of the residents around you. Beneath the surface of this quaint town lies a collection of unusual secrets waiting to be uncovered. Every item you place, every corner you clean, reveals traces of the people who live there. The small details—a dusty letter, a carefully placed teacup, a plant resting by the window—each holds a quiet story just waiting to be discovered. Yet, Whisper Town isn’t just about neatness; it’s a playful place too. You might find yourself tinkering with a vintage gramophone, squeezing a rubber duck, or sneaking a tissue from a box, as if the town itself is softly calling out to you through these little gestures.\n\nWith over 1,800 pieces of furniture and more than ten unique home layouts, the game offers endless possibilities for personal expression. Whether you want to line a study wall with towering bookshelves, fill a sunlit greenhouse with flourishing plants, or stock a doomsday shelter full of supplies, the choices are yours to make. Customization goes beyond just placement—wallpapers, flooring, and many pieces of furniture can be recolored or retextured to perfectly suit your mood. Dozens of items even feature unique sound effects, so as you explore and decorate, you don’t just see your home—you hear it come alive. Tap the drums, snap a photo, or run the tap to fully immerse yourself in the environment.\n\nSpending time with the townsfolk deepens your connections and builds friendships, enriching the warmth of everyday moments. Yet, beneath the cozy surface, Whisper Town holds mysteries that hint at something more enigmatic. A flickering number—42—hovers above the museum. A sudden rainbow streaks the sky. Rumors swirl about a “heart-stealing ghost” haunting the old well, and strange tentacles seem to creep from cracks in the town’s foundations. These eerie signs suggest that the town’s story is far from ordinary, and perhaps the one destined to uncover its hidden truths is you. Whisper Town balances the charm of simple, heartfelt living with whispers of deeper mysteries, inviting you to explore, create, and unravel its secrets at your own pace.\n\nRating: 9/10",

      "review": "What starts as a simple task of unpacking and arranging items in [i]Whisper of the House[/i] quickly unfolds into something much deeper. The core loop feels similar to [i]Unpacking[/i]—you’re given a room and a set of belongings to organize. Sometimes there are specific requirements, and other times you’re free to get creative and place things however you like.\n\nWhat really sets it apart, though, are the stories woven into the gameplay. One moment you’re helping a new neighbor move in, and the next you’re uncovering strange, occult secrets hidden around town. The mix of wholesome slice-of-life with a touch of mystery makes it hard to stop playing. Additionally, it allows for an incredible amount of creativity, while still being a task driven game, unlike similar sandbox style games.\n\nI love that you can decorate your own house too, unlocking new items as you go. Items can be rotated, recolored, and even interact with each other—like putting sheets on a bed or stacking plates neatly in the cupboard. It’s a small detail, but it makes everything feel more alive.\n\nIt’s incredibly cozy, oddly addicting, and I keep telling myself “just one more room” before realizing I’ve been playing for hours. If you enjoyed [i]Unpacking[/i] or just want a relaxing decorating game with an engaging story, this one is absolutely worth it.",

Only downfall is I finished all the main tasks and letters within the first day and a half of starting, I WISH there was more letters and houses/store to clean and put together. I love the idea of this game and the style in which its created. I am hoping in the future there will be more letters, maybe more towns, and heck let us have our cat or pup!",

I read a review that claimed it had similar gameplay to Unpacking, and while that's very true, I find this game has 10x more to offer than what Unpacking ever did. Whisper of the House has all the freedom of creativity that I, personally, felt Unpacking heavily lacked. It's plot puts you in the perspective of a housekeeper that can clean, organize, and decorate the spaces your clients assign to you freely! Not to mention the detail of the decor is absolutely outstanding. If you're a huge fan of the Sims, House Flipper 1 or 2, or Stardew Valley, I highly recommend Whisper of the House! Little hint: there is far more than meets the eye to what seems like a typical decorating space game. I adore when wholesome games throw in a bit of something more eerie to keep the player invested, and Whisper of the House does exactly that! I'm incredibly excited to see what's in store for the future of this game!!",

      "review": "作为这个价位的游戏，我认为主创团队仍需认真打磨。\n首先说一下元素。最初买下这款游戏，吸引我的有这几个元素：像素房间设计、沙盒、清日常。进入之后发现实际上还有：抽卡收集、主线故事、彩蛋，附属功能玩法。\n值得一提的是附属功能玩法，比如中间的烤箱、纸箱打包、炼药、调酒等，这些功能性的交互让我觉得很有意思。\n不太认同的部分有：\n1.[b]时间系统[/b]：看得出来有这几种考虑，主世界（小镇）时间季节流动，进入副本（任务房间）后时间照常流动，睡觉过天系统。在这么快的时间流速下，前两点就导致了第三点基本上毫无作用，每晚做完任务，再到外面逛逛，就可以收邮件领新任务了，根本没停。所以其实这三点就形成了不可能三角。\n2.[b]室内人物[/b]：可以看到游戏专门在主世界摆了很多可以坐下的长凳（3A大作梗），既然这样，为什么房间内反而不能控制人物进行交互，还可以催生过家家、走迷宫等各种玩法。现在的交互更像是unpacking这类游戏的点击模式，只能说这一块真的太遗憾了。\n3.[b]装饰玩家社群建设[/b]：游戏里有很多不同主题的家具，其实对装饰玩家来说需要有一定的收集度，但是收集的因素靠抽卡（虽然体验下来对于未抽到的部分可能有一定的概率加成，而且钱也管够，没有让我卡在最后几个物品上）。玩家可以领日常委托，但是日常委托的检测形同虚设，随便摆几个家具就可以通过。至少应该给各类家具增加一些隐藏的tag，然后检测这类家具的出现次数，判断这个房间是否符合要求的主题，这一点技术上应该可以实现，只是需要足够细节。另外呢，现在视频社交平台可以看到有人发自己做得房间很好看，也有一定的交流。所以我非常遗憾游戏没有能内嵌一个互相评分的系统，可以点击进入别人设计的房间并且评分，达到多少评分可以得到额外的奖励。\n此外呢，主线故事有点贪多贪全，然后用一个完成美梦的外星人来串联，每个留下的印象不太深刻。加上节奏接二连三让人玩着玩着只想快点过了主线进入后面自由发挥的阶段。玩到后面就是感觉这个游戏也就贵在家具体量上了，但真要谈体量，自由上色家具、一些类型（如果蔬、名画、可晾挂服装、床上用品等）是不是还有更多扩展的可能？总之就是30-60区间价格的游戏，我会报有更大的期待。期待游戏会更新",

And i'm not one of those Sims players that like to create things for no reason, i sadly need that small part of \"hey can you help me move in\" or \"redecorate the house, a friend is joining me\".\n\nYou also have a whole town to explore and walk around and furnitures to collect that you can freely place in your homes, which is more of the Sims direction i would say where you are free to do whatever you want to do.\n\nSo if you not the biggest creator and creative guy, i still recommend this one above a lot of others simply because it features the quests, town to explore and so much more. Also it is freaking 15€ max, that's a steal, just sayin not only for all the coding necessary to make it work so smooth but also for all the pixelart that comes with it.",

      "review": "内容太少了，不仅是剧情，房型、家具种类、可互动建筑都太少，地图空空的，比如地毯店旁边的车，很适合做店铺或者剧情的类地标竟然只能戳一下。无论是盲盒还是图鉴能不能做个收集度的百分比条有时候以为抽全了但是差一个，因为UI做的不明显又分不清那是黑色家具还是没抽出来的，盲盒比较有创意但是没有做出盲盒的精髓，纯疲惫式抽家具，要不咱们把基础家具直接售卖，盲盒做成真盲盒，分成几个主题盲盒，内容是一些特别有设计的家居套装（不限制家具个数），这样代金券也有地方花了也不至于后期盲盒店无人光顾。说到家具就要说到食物盲盒，后边家具都能买了为什么食物还是要抽，那个811和面包店可以卖点东西吗，不装修的时候连个路人都没有真有点灵异了，NPC就纯NPC点击就说一自以为很玄的话，沙滩上那姐大半夜晒太阳但是下雨了又有人知道打伞，镇上总想突出一些克苏鲁和灵异感实则像咖啡店里卖空调一样突兀，没有合理的世界观设定显得很多《特色》充满了不和谐和元素堆砌感。镜头移动很痛苦，人一动场景跟人一样快速移动，人一停场景点刹我已经晕车到胃部蠕动，作者有多观察现实吗没观察过可以借鉴星露谷，糟糕的体验导致我不会探索小镇太多，即使使用了鼠标移动但是因为以上问题：人和场景黏在一起像瓷砖上打香皂了一样快速出溜，就不会在路上多闲逛一会。然后是文案相关问题，肉眼可见的文学素养高中水平，背景交代的不好，世界观设定的不完整，显得文案很想咖啡店售卖的空调，文案的表达水平(讲话方式、语言节奏等等)该提高了，大家讲话的时候没感觉到他们是那个场景中的人，创新的前提是日常能够做到还原日常，诡异的事起码在地球上都是基于日常发生的\n解谜好像是游戏的卖点之一，但是这个引导、暗示、逻辑性都不够，你可以是个简单的推理解谜，但是目前做的像缺胳膊少腿的盲猜游戏，科学哥的剧情去爷爷家打扫一圈就没了，回来还以为有什么剧情结果就没了，给爷爷打扫的设计是有点意思的但是做的没头没尾，露娜的小屋，进到小隔间里为啥不让拿着蜡烛，敲缝隙又是因为什么里面有魔法鬼怪克苏鲁吗一样都没有吧，进去盲摸也摸不出来啥特殊道具，明明能手持家具穿梭在每个屋子，就不能设计成露娜在上个出租屋用剩下的一段蜡烛一直不知道放哪所以第二次进她家主角在发现缝隙以后去客厅拿蜡烛顺便告诉她一声再进到隔间里吗，没有跟房东的扯皮吗房东消失术？不要说因为一些内测玩家才导致的你们修修改改最后剧情如此萎缩，改就往好了改就往逻辑通畅了改，也别什么都用小镇有魔法来敷衍逻辑漏洞，，主角看到缝隙连说都不说一声黑灯瞎火自己钻进去了？？？为什么。进去以后也不能和露娜对话或者打电话告诉她她家里有个隔间，进去转一圈出来了我也不知道我该干什么，只能把隔间里的东西搬出来过两天露娜自己发现那些东西，为什么，为什么不能直接说，她们不是有联系方式吗，为什么要我把东西搬出来但是这又不是个打扫的任务。剧情经常一块出现好几个做的乱七八糟的，这是主线是不是应该流畅一些，给人的感觉是做了一堆支线然后分析一堆逻辑不通看起来迷之玄学的话然后就没了....\n然后说到玩的最久的装修环节，装修给七分，喜欢里边对日用品之类的的细致分类，卫生巾、护垫、助行器、各种牌子的洗发水。没装好的屋子可以再修修改改，颜色搭配也挺好看的。建议家具分类阳间一点，即使有三个筛选栏我也没办法快速找到床和床垫，除了生活用品牌子多以外衣服、衣架、桌子款式啥的是不是也可以增加一些设计、数量、色彩呢，感觉美术这里会更抠细节一些于是就忘掉了大关系才是最重要的，三张桌子长得一样细节不同的前提是有更多的桌子的立体构成不一样，其下的分支才是差不多的桌子不同的颜色和细节，这才是用心做游戏。整个游戏的大框架都蛮差的（。）细节又有在认真的扣，难评。装修那一块用的很痛苦，没有批量改颜色，理想家的房型都确定下来了为啥就不能捆绑一下做个批量上色的选择，改颜色右手边和地下的墙、地板经常被色板挡住挪也挪不开，建议让我挪走因为我看不见效果了，色板希望能改成拾色器颜色太纯了容易不好看，谁家墙哇绿哇绿的把家具都要晃没了。然后希望理想家的主题能多出点相关家具，总体的种类还是太少了，要么主题屋做都做不全，要么两个房同样的主题几乎装得一模一样，房型也可以多出一点，窗户设置可以删除好吗或者多来几种窗帘，我不希望实验室锃明瓦亮的阳光直射烧杯量瓶，现在理想家的默认墙和地板很像是随机生成的，主题就那几个，玩着玩着就没内容了。还有宠物相关的东西有一点点少，我想在家养各种品种的狗你们能不能开个宠物店啊卖点宠物的各种用品，现在连个猫砂盆都没有养猫怎么可以没有猫砂盆和开盖废纸箱，理想家也可以放在一些没开放的门市房里这样就可以装修宠物店、咖啡店啥的了，再然后再再再再多出点家具吧主题家具的种类和数量真的不够\n总体48还是贵了看看隔壁星露谷那么多东西才定价四十多，如果这是个装修游戏请认真开发装修相关事项，让用户有个良好的装修体验，目前为止给美术和音乐点赞，这俩能值二十，剩下28如同打水漂",

Not only do you get to design rooms, but there’s also an active story to follow, a city to clean up, and even a small mystery to solve. I took my time and ended up playing for about 13 hours. Don’t get me wrong, you could probably rush through it in under 2 hours, but the whole point of the game is to decorate, enjoy yourself, and not just fulfill requests as quickly as possible.\n\nIt’s the perfect balance: enough gameplay to stay relaxing without ever becoming boring. You can also keep playing after finishing the story, since the notification board updates with new design jobs every day.\n\nPLEASE add more gameplay and objects in the future to give it more of a reason to play after finishing the story, because this really has the potential to become one of my most favorite games of all time.",

There you help out by helping your neighbors unpack, clean and organize their homes and/or businesses. You also clean up the town, rummage through the bins for goodies, which can be used to decorate or recycle (for vouchers), There are basic puzzles to solve, hidden areas, and a story with a mystery.  You can even pet the cats! It is really a fun, laid back, cozy game. Recommend this if you like this type of game.",

      "review": "I’ve been waiting two months for [i]Whisper of the House[/i], and it did not disappoint! The game carries the gentle spirit of Unpacking, yet offers something more personal—an invitation to decorate and shape your own home in a warm, pixelated world. I played the demo before release, and they've come a long way in optimizing the game play; mechanics are smoother and more polished, but I feel like there's room for improvement!\n\n[h3] PRAISES [/h3]\n♡ The bulletin board offers replay-ability with the extra rooms to decorate. So after you've completed the main story, you can still get more challenges and a space to continue designing.\n♡ My personal favorite is its sound design. The soundtracks create an atmosphere of a soft setting the perfect tone for cozy evenings.\n♡ The movement when exploring the map is butter smooth. The whole map hopping from place to place looting trash cans and petting cats is always a fun idle thing to do!\n\n[h3] IMPROVEMENTS [/h3]\n♡ I found unlocking Luna’s second quest was unexpectedly tricky—its hint to trigger the next storyline is buried in a skippable line of dialogue. A clearer hint, or a way to revisit key information [spoiler](much like the secret notes in the alchemy questline)[/spoiler], could keep players from losing the thread of the story. This make me skip unlocking [spoiler] achievements [i] It Takes Two, Double Bed, [/i] and [i] territory expansion [/i] blocked. It's skippable and I was able to finish the game without needing to complete it. [/spoiler]\n♡ I also wish for more freedom in customization. Recoloring feels a little scattered: some items can be repainted, others come locked in shop-specific colors (e.g. there's a blue swivel chair and an orange recolor in the shop that's two items), while some cannot be changed at all. A more streamlined system could make creativity flow as effortlessly as the gameplay.\n♡ There's minor translation slips where Chinese sentences remain untranslated, though they’re small bumps in an otherwise immersive experience.\n\nDespite these details, [i] Whisper of the House [/i] shines with a retro-cozy charm. It leaves me wanting more—more furniture, more storylines, more chances to revisit this gentle world! For now, it may feel short, but I'm sure it will welcome us back with more updates and more cozy moments.",

(cute pets alert! - you can pat the cats, I repeat, YOU CAN PAT THE CATTOS)\n\nWhisper of the House is a cozy organisation and decorating simulation game with cute and vibrant pixel art. The game takes place in a nice little town near the ocean and filled with greeneries. Although, there seems to be some weird stuff happening here and there (˵ ¬ᴗ¬˵).\n\nI find the story pretty interesting, but I have to point out that the translation is not 100% the best. The english translation is at best at an understandable level, but some mistakes can still easily be noticed by fluent english speakers. Not to mention, I find the story tad bit short (took me 10hours to 100% the game, and that includes me exploring every corner and taking a lot of time trying to decorate my own home). I hope it's because they just released not long ago, so they're still working on expanding the story or some sort.\n\nThat's honestly some of the cons I've noticed. Personally I don't mind it much because the decorating aspect of the game remains wide and flexible to the players (except certain areas as part of the story). Moreover, the OSTs in this game is very relaxing, making my playtime fairly enjoyable ദ്ദി ˉ͈̀꒳ˉ͈́ )✧. I'd give this game an 8/10 for now until we get more potential updates (very hopeful here!).\n\nAlso, it really scratched that itch of wanting \"more\" from the Unpacking game (yes, they are very similar! so, do get this game if you enjoyed Unpacking very much).\n\nPS: I played the game on my Steam Deck and personally, I think it runs fairly well. Although, please do take note that it is not 100% compatible, so there are certain issues such as needing to use the touch screen from time to time and also the text being too small in certain areas. I have to admit the game is definitely better on PC since it's more point and clicky rather than a console game, but I'm lazy and I prefer to play on my bed.",

I do wish it was longer as I was having a very very good time and it only took me around 6 hours to 100% complete the game and get all of the achievements. Overall I would recommend it if you enjoy games like Unpacking where the game play is more important than the story. The story is there to just give a little reason for why you're doing what you're doing but it isn't totally necessary. I do still have more items to collect solely for the ability to go around and freely decorate the properties in the game I own but I don't know how much of an incentive that will be for me to go back into the game as the rooms are relatively small and it wouldn't take much time to do so. Solid 4/5 for me. No real reason to replay but I greatly enjoyed my play through and hope for either more content or a follow up game.",

So far there was one where you could decorate how you see fit, but with a few items that had to be included and another was a music shop that you had to place every items in the exact spot the game wanted you to put them. Then there are some that have you clean up the place as well.\n\nThere is a leveling system in place. Only thing I have been given was vouchers. You get them for completing the levels as well and are used for the games gotcha mechanics. You can also find some vouchers in bushes. There are 3 types of gotcha mechanics so far that I have came across. Food, decorations and furniture. It unlocks items for use in your house and for the levels where it allows you to decorate how you set fit.\n\nI can definitely recommend if you are into these types of games.",

The story isn't deep but it has some interesting moments, the scavenger hunt is fun, though the payoff is a little weak.\r\n\r\nWhat this game sets out to do though it does very well. As a dollhouse game it's very successful, I wish there was more more missions and buildings to play around with (not getting to go into the library, farm, lighthouse, or campervan was a bit of a let down) but I think it is overall really solid. I hope theres some updates in the future to add more furniture and missions. I will probably get a few more hours out of this decorating the houses you unlock and re-arranging some of the mission areas.",

Many have compared it to Unpacking, but I also found it more familiar to childhood social mmo's I grew up with, and like a gamified version of custom player rooms you could decorate yourself. I've regularly jumped between the various requests and my own houses to redecorate as I've earned more furniture, and love the variety you get from job to job with what the tasks require. The item descriptions and more mecab secrets have also kept putting a smile on my face for each new one I find!\r\n\r\nThe only critique I have so far is the controls. I was very excited from the demo that my control does work for play, and for the overall game it functions fine, but it does get pretty glitchy when trying to open up and navigate menues. I frequently have to tab in or out from the game, or click with the mouse for a bit, for the controller to work again. Outside of menues though it works great, and hasn't taken away from the bulk of the game, so I'd love to see this improved in the future!",

NPC互动：除了任务剧情，基本上没有什么NPC互动，可以增加一些比如培养好感，支线剧情，解锁新家具之类的；\r\n5. 宠物：游戏里有各种可爱的猫猫狗狗，但玩家自己却没办法养宠物？家门口的猫都撸了无数次了，然后还只是个家门口的野猫；\r\n\r\n游戏整体是不错的，但我感觉更像是一个Demo，可能游戏的重点在于想让玩家通过帮不同的人布置房间，通过不同的物件，了解他们的故事，但我感觉这游戏完全可以有发展成星露谷那种游戏的潜力，还是希望之后能出更多的内容和游戏玩法吧",

Не до всех вещей додумаешься сам, но большинство интуитивно накликаешь. Отсутствие перевода на русский язык совершенно не мешает, некоторые моменты можно перевести через экранный переводчик.\r\nЕсть несколько домов для обустройства, большой простор для фантазии. \r\n\r\nИз минусов - очень короткая. Хотелось бы больше контента и больше сюжета за эти деньги. Прошла игру и собрала все достижения за 9 часов :( \r\n\r\nИгра 7/10, к прохождению рекомендую",

Nothing that'll stop me from playing. Haven't finished yet - there's a surprising amount of content in this game! Lots of enjoyable puzzles and secrets. I was not expecting much going in since most games like this are cash grabs, but not this one!\r\n\r\nThere's clearly a lot of effort, time, and talent that went into the game! Highly recommend!",

I love the quests and how I can freely roam around town! Right-clicking the anomalies is also so satisfying.\n\nThere’s always something cozy about pixel games paired with the right music.

      "review": "Have you ever wanted to move to a mysterious town to become a housekeeper, interior designer, and paranormal investigator all at once? Well boy do I have the game for you! Whisper of the House drops you into a cute and vibrant little town, where the townspeople will pay you to clean, organize, and design homes and businesses. But you start to encounter some... weird objects, not to mention the anonymous and vaguely threatening letters you start receiving in the mail. \n\nOh, and you can pet cats!\n\nThe gameplay primarily consists of completing jobs for the townspeople (which progresses the story), fixing \"anomalies,\" decorating your own homes (you start with one, and acquire 2 more throughout the game), and taking \"model home\" requests. There are also a few minigames -- making potions, mixing drinks, and growing unique plants (which you can then use to decorate with). Finally, you can wander around the town, which is just so cute and cozy!! It's rewarding to explore, because there are anomalies and secrets hidden around town, and sometimes you'll also run into characters you've helped previously. You can also raid crates and trash cans to find items, and you can find tokens scattered around.\n\nThe decorating mechanics are super simple and satisfying! Everything you pick up/set down makes a little sound that relates to what it is, which I love. The organization and decorating are VERY reminiscent of unpacking (another game I love, and probably a majority of Whisper players also love, LOL) but Whisper is more focused on the aesthetic/creativity aspect than the organization aspect (for example, there are a lot less drawers/cabinets to organize things in; there are a few, but mostly items are placed where they're visible). You can layer certain objects and even cause some objects to interact with each other (such as the ice cream cones and ice cream maker) to create new ones. \n\nDifferent jobs require different things from you as the housekeeper -- some are more focused on cleaning, some require you to place items in specific spots, and some simply ask you to decorate as you see fit. One of the cool things about this game is the variety of places you get to work on -- not only homes and apartments, but also different businesses, and even a cemetery. \n\nThere is a huge variety of items, some of which make up themed sets. Furniture, appliances, decor, print items, plants, rugs, and food/drink can all be bought at different stores and vending machines around town, which are marked on the map. They're acquired through a blind box/gacha mechanic, but it's really easy to get tokens, so it's not stressful or difficult to unlock all the items. You'll be paid tokens after each job, when you're \"promoted\" by the company, and after completing model home requests. \n\nAt the mall, you can buy duplicates of any furniture you have unlocked. For food and drink, you can buy duplicates at the convenience stores, and for plants, at the Flower Shop. I spent SO MUCH time just decorating and making spaces look cute and cozy, I'm sure I could have finished the game faster but I was having so much fun. There are no time penalties or deadlines, so I suggest taking it at whatever pace you want! \n\nThroughout the game, you get to know some really fun characters and help them with more than just organizing their homes. The little character stories are actually really heartwarming and adorable! Make sure to return to the homes and businesses you worked on, because some of the characters have secondary requests. I thought I was stuck for a while because no more requests were triggering, but I still had a missing character and anomalies... turns out I didn't know how to trigger one of the character's secondary requests. \n\nOverall, the game is pretty straightforward, and you can get most of the achievements and find most of the anomalies as long as you thoroughly explore and investigate everything. I got around 80/89 achievements by myself, and used a guide for the rest. There are a few things that are a little convoluted, the worst one (in my opinion) being the issue I mentioned before about triggering a characters request. Quick spoilers ahead in the following paragraph:\n\n/BEGIN SPOILERS/\n\nI got stuck after having completed all but one of the jobs in town, because I didn't know how to trigger Luna's secondary request. I had found the secret room and even interacted with the mousetrap, but when I returned to talk to her in response to her letter, I didn't get the hint about what I was supposed to do. She says something like \"I hear sobbing at night, and noises in the bathroom.\" Ok, so I thought, I need to go check the secret room again as well as the bathroom. I click around, nothing happens. What you're meant to do is take the mousetrap from the secret room, put it in the bathroom, then wait a day and you'll receive a Daily Whisper about a homeless person being found in her apartment, as well as a letter from her asking you to come help her again (her secondary request). Honestly I don't get how you're expected to figure that out, the mousetrap is just one of many random cluttered items in the secret room and she makes no mention of rats or animals of any kind, just \"noises\" and \"sobbing.\" I think if she had said something like \"I wonder if there are animals?\" after mentioning the noises, it might have clicked? I dunno if this is just me but that was frustrating because you're meant to finish that quest line early in the game, but I didn't get to it until near the end when I finally looked at a guide.\n\n/END SPOILERS/ \n\nBesides my issue with Luna's requests, I only have small complaints about the game. Honestly, it instantly became one of my favorites -- it's just basically everything I love in one game. But here are my small criticisms, and some requests:\n\n-All items should be able to be rotated all 4 ways. Certain items in the game can only be rotated 2 ways. Also, sometimes items that normally CAN be rotated 4 ways become locked into 2-way rotation when they're stacked (ex. a TV on top of a TV stand: both items by themselves can normally rotate 4 ways, but when stacked, they can't. If you un-stack them, rotate them to the position you want, then stack them again, it works). \n-Please add a search function for the storage! The filters are sometimes helpful, but sometimes not so much. Especially once you have all the items, finding a specific one can be very tedious. I think the best solution would be the option to search items by name. Being able to narrow down into smaller categories would also be good (ex. \"bedframes,\" \"computers\")\n-This one is probably a long shot, and it's not so much a criticism as just a request for future development. I would looveeee character customization! Doesn't have to be crazy or anything, but a few hair styles/colors and different outfits would be amazing. It made me sad looking at the cute clothes and wigs used as decor items in the game and wishing my character could wear them T_T\n-Also perchance a long shot but... pets? Cats are a pretty big part of the game, and there's already the coding allowing us to pet the ones in town, plus lots of pet-related decor items. I would love it if we could take in a cat (or dog) that could either just sit or walk around one of our houses (and could be pet of course). \n-And finally... please more content!!! Pretty please a sequel or DLC or something. I want more jobs and more Whisper Town lore!!! No pressure, I know it takes time and effort but I hope there will be more eventually! <3",

Ich bin mir aber sicher, dass noch weitere Stunden folgen werden, denn nach Beenden der Story gibt es noch genug zu tun ♡ \n\nIch habe lange nach ähnlichen Spielen wie Unpacking gesucht und bin hier rundum abgeholt worden. Ich hatte gar nicht damit gerechnet überhaupt eine \"übergreifende\" Story zu bekommen und war schon beim ersten Auftrag positiv überrascht (und auch ein bisschen verunsichert, ob es irgendwo ne Horror Genre Einordnung gab, die ich übersehen hatte...xD bin ängstlich, okay?). \nAnyway war ich tapfer und habe mich auch durch fragwürdige Möbelverteilung (was macht die Kamera da?!) nicht aufhalten lassen und Auftrag um Auftrag erledigt. Es wurde nie eintönig und bis ganz zum Schluss habe ich gehofft, dass es jetzt noch irgendwie weiter geht, weitere Stadtareale betretbar werden und ich das Gefühl bekomme die Story ist irgendwie \"abgeschlossen\".\n\nIch hoffe, dass wir in Zukunft noch das ein oder andere DLC sehen werden - ich habe das Gefühl die Geschichte rund um Whispertown ist noch nicht auserzählt. \n\nAlles in allem: große Empfehlung für alle, die Unpacking mochten und nicht nur gerne Pixelräume einrichten, sondern sich von einer cozy-spooky Story überraschen lassen möchten :3",

As many have said, if you liked Unpacking, you'll most probably like Whisper of the House, too. \n\nHowever, the game still feels a bit unpolished. The menu isn't as intuitive as it should be, and some effects feel like they should be softer, like sleeping (you click on sleep, and it's literally only a second or two of animation and the night has passed). So, some things feel slightly rushed and clunky. There are also several lines that aren't translated in English. \n\nIf you're willing to overlook these small details, then I'm sure you'll enjoy playing Whisper of the House.",

Arranging the furniture is super fun and relaxing, and the story is surprisingly engaging—with little unexpected twists that keep things exciting in a lighthearted way. Honestly, I just wish the game were longer, because I managed to finish the main storyline in only 2–3 days.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that since it’s a brand-new release, there are still quite a few minor bugs, and the user interface can feel a bit clunky. For example, there’s no clear category system for furniture or decorations within the same collection. Still, none of these issues really get in the way of enjoying the story or collecting achievements.",

(because the object snaps into place when dropped) \n\neither tell me what to do correctly, or don't tell me what to do. \n\nalso, this level might have been more reasonable as a tutorial, but putting a level where I have to follow put-thing-in-glowing-outline directions after I've already gotten the hang of doing things my way is awful. feels like being put at the kiddy table after making thanksgiving dinner.",

There's an insane amount of pixel art assets that can be used to decorate (in total 1k? maybe more?). Many assets are also rotatable or even interactive. The story is surprisingly neat, but it does feel like there could be more. The main story is short and can be completed in 6-7h (more if you take your time), but the game also offers a somewhat open ended game loop -- it's possible to decorate (empty) rooms with assets (based on a random topic) but this only holds as far as one's creativity goes.",

I was nervous that it would be lacking the \"secret\" part of the game, but I think it does a great job with keeping you intrigued. I love it. I have posted about this and shared my love for it to everyone. Definitely buy this game. You will not regret it!",

I enjoyed the little mystery you're introduced to early on, and there are several fun little puzzles within the game that I liked taking the time to figure out. You can also pet the cats you find! \r\n\r\nHome design is a big part of the game, of course, so if you enjoy just designing rooms and collecting all the furniture pieces, you'll probably get a lot more hours out of the games. I also like that you can go back and re-design rooms you have worked on before- if you get more furniture you like and want to redecorate showrooms, you can. You also get a few properties of your own which you can mostly decorate as you'd like- however one home seems to have the wallpaper and tiling locked, meaning you'll need to theme the room around it. \r\n\r\nOverall, I didn't face any bugs and I had fun playing the game. If I could add suggestions for improvements- some of the missions within the showrooms ended up being the same, just in different rooms. For example, I did a mission to design a room for watching movies twice, just in separate spaces. For the small amount of quests actually available, it was disappointing to do the same thing twice. I would also love to see more showroom quests, or more buildings/jobs following the game that are just meant to be decorated.",

That was unexpected but added a lot to the narrative. Everything about this game is adorable and you can play it as meticulous as you want or as brain dead as you want, the guides are really helpful in completing levels and the story. If I did have to give critique, I wish all items could be color customised and not just certain items. I think that would really elevate the decorating experience with more options. That and I wish we could engage with the NPC's more. Aside from that I really enjoyed this game and I'm looking forward to completing it",

      "review": "i would recommend this game, but i do have complicated feelings about it. \nthis game is incredibly charming and reeaallyyy fun. the unpacking mechanics are so nice and having the different levels makes it really enjoyable and unique. I am so captivated by the tiny glimpses of story you get with each level, but at the same time I feel confused talking to npcs. Each narrative is so random and kind of half baked, it makes me want more but they're so short lived and inconclusive that it leaves me feeling pretty dissatisfied. This game is kind of mysterious, which I like, but the 15 levels available don't feel like enough to me. You kind of get thrown all of these levels, and then everything comes to a stand still. I walked around the town for half an hour trying to figure out what I was missing. \nI just think for a game that is so interesting at it's core, it needs a more structured playing experience.",

It itched the decorating part and interactive part that animal crossing: happy home lacked. \n\nThe gameplay is creative and fun but the story was just way too short for my taste. I didn’t even realize I was done until I saw there wasn’t much abnormalities left on the museum. \n\nI would recommend this when it’s more on sale because the story only had taken me roughly 10 hours in the expand of 2 days to finish. \n\nIf you adore decorating, cozy and small interactions within a game- I do recommend you try this game!",

I think I only ran into 1 bug the entire time I've played which is the search feature not working correctly for storage, but it's been reported (and there is a workaround). The devs also already put out a patch for the game at launch.\n\nI highly recommend this game!\n\nMy only qualm:\n- Home designs can feel limited due to lack of matching item sets, lack of color customizing of some items/walls/floors (some can be customized, but not all) but that's really it. \n\nI'd be so excited if the devs continued to update the game and add more features, items, quests, etc. but it really does feel \"complete\".",

But the game does feel a little half baked for a full release. There aren't very many locations to decorate, 15 at most which I feel is a very small amount for a full released game. I'm unsure of the developers plans for continued updates but I feel the game is missing a lot of content. There's so much potential here so I hope they continue support as this was a delightful little experience!",

This definitely scratched that Unpacking type itch for me, and bonus points for having a lot of leeway in placing items and not being forced into putting things in certain spots to proceed. It look me 8 hours to 100% achievements, though keep in mind there hadn't been any guides created yet when I was playing so that last hour was mostly hunting for the last few.\n\nI think there are a couple improvements that could be made to the end and translations especially, if things were worded a bit better it would make things a lot more clearer to understand story-wise. But for me the gameplay is what I came for - and it very pleasantly exceeded my expectations. \n\nSome super creative level design here, and I love the option to play even longer with all the showroom options and personal houses to decorate if you wish. Would love to see more like this in the future.",

      "review": "I'm not completely done yet, but so far I have to say I am very impressed. It starts out cozy at first and the mystery element develops slowly, which isn't an issue for me personally, in fact I prefer it even. The actual tasks are all a little different from each other, sometimes you can design a room however you want, sometimes you just have to place objects in their designated spots or it's a mix of both, so the gameplay doesn't get boring. The rooms also each have their own little secrets and mechanics to discover. The gacha mechanic for items is a bit of a weird choice in my opinion, but also not really an issue since you can obtain more than enough currency. The town itself is very beautiful and atmospheric, especially at night, I love that you can pet the cats! <3 The only thing I'd like is some sort of character customization, but I'm not a developer myself and not sure if that would work out with the graphics, if you can even see significant changes on the character model. But still I can only recommend the game!\n\nUpdate: I've played through the entire game and played some more after some new items were added and I still love it! The fact that you can now change layouts and have more of your own homes to design is great and what I had wished for after my playthrough. The game leaves you just naturally wanting more and I do hope they release DLC for this game or something, I'd definitely be the first to buy it! Though one thing that bugs me, is that you can change the wallpaper in the starter home, but not in the apartment with the balcony for some reason? Please fix that!",

Я за два часа игры оформила супермаркет, музыкальный магазин, пекарню, квартиру собачницы, пляжный домик, поискала котёнка в тц! Очень разнообразные задачи, у меня часто проблемы с выбором чего-то одного из сотни вариантов, здесь есть задания на оформление интерьера из всего вашего хранилища, но большая часть заданий -- помощь с вещами и мебелью заказчиков\r\n\r\nЕсли вы любите пиксель-арт, вам стоит купить эту игру! Стооолько красиво нарисованных деталей интерьера, которые ещё и супер легко покупаются и дают вам творить -- это с ума сойти. \r\n\r\nНравится мистический подтекст, нагнетающий атмосферу, нравится городок, заказчики. По каким-то их вещам создаётся полный портрет человека. Да, у девушки магазин-пекарня, булочки, хлеб, но в спальне всякое для мистических ритуалов, а её парень вообще давным давно пропал... \r\n\r\nЕщё отмечу саунд-дизайн, ставишь стол из стекла -- слышишь, что это стекло. Духовка приятно гудит, стиральная машина неприятно шумит, бумага шелестит. \r\n\r\nВ общем, это чудо, не знаю к чему всё идёт, но однозначно пройду игру до конца. Не хватает русского перевода, у меня скудные навыки владения английским, некоторые нюансы перевожу через переводчик, но глобально это не ощущается как проблема",

But the optional themed room quests is easily as enjoyable! Really love the art style!\nWish there's ways to categories the furniture & objects for easier sorting, instead of having to scroll through the whole list to place an object that I have in my mind. Hope that there's future updates to change the walls and floors!",

      "review": "This game is instantly addicting. Obviously inspired from Unpacking, but with a more interactive twist, world, & characters. However, it does have its quirks. \r\n\r\nThe actual interface itself can be confusing and mildly frustrating. Sometimes you want to rotate something one other direction, but you can't. The customize / remodel tool that allows you to change furniture, walls, floor colors & styles is a major selling point I would love so much more if it worked better. \r\n\r\nIf there's a way to change the colors on interactable kitchen counters... well I never found it. Things like the stove and sink just turn on when I try to customize, and who wants one or two pieces the wrong color? Not enough color options either. \r\n\r\nThe UI is large, and disabling it is frustrating because it doesn't show you item names anymore, map to switch floors easier disapears, as well as storage and design tool. I need those up, everything else gone. \r\n\r\nHowever, the game is fun, addicting, and feels unique even though I've played similar games.",

      "review": "I enjoyed this game a great deal, and it's a bummer to not be able to recommend this game on the merits of what it does well - but it truly does feel like a half-finished experience.\r\n\r\nThe parts that work are wonderful and memorable - two levels early in the story have incredible hidden secrets that truly make you feel smart for figuring them out. But the back half of the game becomes repetitive and relatively uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe game promises a great deal about a hidden story to unravel, but its most interesting ideas go totally unexplored and unexplained. There are big missing chunks of story here that can't help but feel like the dev just ran out of time, and disappointingly, it takes what could have been, I think, a truly incredible game to a pretty unmemorable one. The decorating is fun, but the economy has zero challenge whatsoever. You get thousands of 'vouchers' for completing easy in-game tasks, and after that can just spam the merchants, which only award furniture at random, to get everything you need. You can buy individual pieces - but only if you've unlocked them already, completely removing any incentive for doing so.\r\n\r\nThe decorating challenges, which I suspect were added to pad playtime, are pointless. Unlike some decorating games that 'tag' furniture with associated characteristics, adding an actual mechanic to decorating, the challenges in this game simply give you four or five pieces of furniture to put in a giant room, and then arbitrarily let you put down an amount of furniture (it never tells you how much). You could literally plonk down random items for ten seconds and would be rewarded with completing the challenge with full marks, which completely took the fun out of it for me.\r\n\r\nThe world-building is charming and the little interactions are super cool. The first two hours of this game showcase what it could have been, and I'm disappointed that it couldn't keep up that level of quality. Buy it on sale and enjoy it for what it is, but I can't recommend it for the listed price.",

As a new organizer in the field of interior design, you are given requests throughout town to aid people who have empty space and stuff to fill it with. \n\nThe art is absolutely adorable, the town is fun to explore, and there's SO MUCH CUTE PIXEL FURNITURE! :D While exploring town, there's litter to clean up, mysteries and treasures to find, and cats to pet! And you get to decorate your own little apartment! There's a good variety of requests, too, in both homes and businesses. The day/night shift adds a lot of dynamic elements to the town without hindering you as a player. \n\nSo far, this feels like a great cozy game that keeps you busy without punishing you for going at your own pace. And did I say how cute the art is?? I know you can see it in the photos, but there's so many different furniture pieces to find!",

There are SO many secrets and collectibles to discover, and the story is surprisingly compelling for a cozy decorating game. The graphics are adorable and the music is so relaxing. I'm about done with story missions it seems, but I played straight through without really spending time decorating my own homes so I still have plenty of gameplay and collecting to get through! My only real gripe so far is that the storage is a bit annoying to navigate. The categories are too broad and need subcategories. For example: chairs, sofas, tables, shelves, beds, and other large furniture items are all in the same category and they're all jumbled up. I wish I could select a category just for seating, bedding, tables, etc. That being the only problem I have with it, the developers really knocked this one out of the park! I would love to see more levels added, whether that comes in the form of paid DLC or free updates- I'm on board!",

Conforme avanzas, conoces nuevos personajes que abren sus propios locales y te piden ayuda para organizarlos, lo que da una sensación de progreso en la ciudad bastante agradable.\n\nLo que más me ha gustado:\n-  Mantiene una atmósfera cozy, pero con un giro interesante: una historia de misterio que se va desarrollando mientras decoras. (Esto es lo que más me llamaba del juego y me alegro de que haya mantenido esa idea).\n- Casi todos los objetos se pueden colocar en distintas posiciones, lo que da mucha libertad creativa. También puedes modificar el suelo y pared de tu casa, aunque no en todas las zonas.\n- Gran variedad de ítems desbloqueables mediante el sistema tipo \"gacha\" (o gatcha), usando tickets que puedes conseguir buscando en la basura, vendiendo lo que no usas o cumpliendo tareas de decoración.\n\n\nLo que no me gusta:\n- No entiendo el mensajito de que pasan los días, igual he pasado algo por alto pero no le encuentro el sentido y me resulta a veces molesto.\n- Creo que voy a conseguir todos los items de cajas demasiado rápido porque me premian con demasiados tickets. Igual en un futuro van a tener que sacar una expansión con más elementos decorativos para que pueda seguir gastando mis tickets, jajaja.\n\nEn general, es una propuesta diferente y muy entretenida. Si te gustan los juegos tranquilos de decoración, pero además quieres una pizca de intriga, puede gustarte.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDEUTSCH:\nBevor ich anfange, möchte ich sagen, dass ich das Spiel noch nicht durchgespielt habe.\nIch habe ein paar Bugs gefunden, die ich bereits gemeldet habe, aber mir gefällt es bisher, und ich wollte eine Rezension schreiben – vor allem für die Leute, die die Demo ausprobiert haben und nicht wussten, ob nach dem Vorfall mit dem geheimen Raum zu viel geändert werden würde.\n\nWhisper of the House ist ein Einzelspieler-Spiel, bei dem das Hauptziel darin besteht, deinen neuen Nachbarn beim Auspacken und Einrichten ihrer Häuser und Geschäfte in einer wachsenden Stadt zu helfen. Während du voranschreitest, lernst du neue Charaktere kennen, die ihre eigenen Läden eröffnen und dich bitten, ihnen bei der Organisation zu helfen. Dadurch entsteht ein sehr angenehmes Gefühl von Fortschritt in der Stadt.\n\nWas mir am meisten gefallen hat:\n\n- Es behält eine gemütliche Atmosphäre bei, aber mit einem interessanten Twist: eine Mystery-Geschichte, die sich nach und nach entwickelt, während man dekoriert. (Das war das, was mich am meisten am Spiel gereizt hat, und ich freue mich, dass diese Idee beibehalten wurde).\n- Fast alle Objekte können in verschiedenen Positionen platziert werden, was viel kreative Freiheit gibt. Außerdem kann man den Boden und die Wände des eigenen Hauses verändern – allerdings nicht in allen Bereichen.\n- Große Vielfalt an freischaltbaren Items durch ein Gacha-ähnliches System, mit Tickets, die man bekommen kann, indem man im Müll sucht, unbenutzte Dinge verkauft oder Dekorationsaufgaben erfüllt.\n\nWas mir nicht gefällt:\n- Ich verstehe die kleine Nachricht über die vergehenden Tage nicht. Vielleicht habe ich etwas übersehen, aber für mich ergibt sie keinen Sinn und ist manchmal eher störend.\n- Ich glaube, dass ich alle Items aus den Kisten zu schnell bekommen werde, weil man zu viele Tickets geschenkt bekommt. Vielleicht müssen sie in Zukunft eine Erweiterung mit mehr Dekorationsobjekten herausbringen, damit ich meine Tickets weiter ausgeben kann, haha.\n\nInsgesamt ist es ein anderes, aber sehr unterhaltsames Spiel. Wenn du entspannte Dekorationsspiele magst, aber auch ein wenig Spannung haben möchtest, könnte es dir gefallen.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nENGLISH:\nFirst of all, I want to say that I haven’t finished it yet.\nI’ve found a couple of bugs, which I already reported, but I’m enjoying it so far and I wanted to write this review for people who tried the demo and weren’t sure if they would change too much after the incident with the secret room.\n\nWhisper of the House is a single-player game where the main goal is to help your new neighbors unpack and decorate their houses and businesses in a growing town. As you progress, you meet new characters who open their own shops and ask for your help to organize them, which gives a very pleasant sense of progress in the town.\n\nWhat I liked the most:\n\n- It keeps a cozy atmosphere but with an interesting twist: a mystery story that slowly unfolds while you decorate. (This is the thing that most attracted me, and I’m glad they kept that idea).\n- Almost all objects can be placed in different positions, giving a lot of creative freedom. You can also change the floor and walls of your house, although not in every area.\n- Great variety of unlockable items through a gacha-like system, using tickets you can get by searching the trash, selling unused items, or completing decoration tasks.\n\nWhat I didn’t like:\n\n- I don’t understand the little message about the passing days. Maybe I missed something, but it doesn’t make sense to me and sometimes feels a bit annoying.\n- I think I’m going to get all the items from boxes too quickly because they reward you with too many tickets. Maybe in the future they’ll have to release an expansion with more decorative items so I can keep spending my tickets, haha.\n\nOverall, it’s a different but very entertaining game. If you like relaxing decoration games but also want a pinch of intrigue, you might enjoy it.",

It's been a great time so far, and I can't wait to finish and uncover the truth, but I'm far enough in I'm definitely going to be recommending it to my friends.",

Some levels have you place items exactly like a sticker book, some have you organising certain items however you want, some just tell you to open up your own storage and decorate freestyle.

Then theres also the \"free mode\" In which there's no goal; just a simple room you can decorate to your liking. The music also helps with relaxing.\nOverall a very relaxing experience; Definitely recommend!",

      "review": "[h2] 游戏介绍 [/h2]\n《 呓语小镇》是元气弹工作室(GD Studio)制作并发行的一款轻松治愈的装修收纳游戏，玩家将作为一个全能家政工，接受呓语小镇的各种奇怪的委托，包括搬家，收拾房间，打扫卫生，整理遗物等等，在完成他人委托的过程中，还会了解到小镇居民背后的故事，甚至在不经意间影响他们的生活轨迹。\n[h2] 剧情简介 [/h2]\n玩家受到小镇镇长的邀请来到小镇从事家政工作，然而这一切似乎没有表面上看到的那么简单。玩家在完成委托的过程中发现小镇似乎隐藏着不少秘密，尤其是是凭空出现的的金字塔很让人疑惑，塔顶还有数字在不断闪烁，当玩家在处理委托的过程中处理掉异常后，金字塔上的数字也会减少，随着委托不断达成，玩家最后得以进入金字塔，然而真相却有些让人出乎意料。\n[h2] 玩法简介 [/h2]\n如果你玩过《Unpacking》那么这款游戏与前者有着类似的玩法，都是在一个类似于2.5D房子剖面的房间进行收纳整理放置物品，游戏的地图蛮大的，我们在接受委托之后，会在机器人马克的指引下进入房子，一个房子有多个房间，每个房间都有一个单独的进度，放置家具可以增长进度，达到100%后就代表这个房间装修完成。点击机器人就可以拿出家具，再进行合理的摆放，不过有些去委托人会要求玩家在某些位置摆放指定的家具，只要完成委托内容其他的不管也没事。除了摆家具外，还有些委托是打扫房间。玩家右键点击污渍清扫，点击破损的家具可以将其拆分成废材，最后将所有垃圾和废材全部扔进垃圾桶就完成委托，也就是归纳分类。委托达成之后就可以获得点券以及房产作为奖励，点券可以在商店抽盲盒获得新家具用以装饰我们获得的房产。当然了游戏的主线任务还是要找到小镇的异常，异常可能在任何的物品上面，玩家需要仔细观察，不过游戏中还是很明显的，散发着紫色光芒，右键疯狂点击就可以击碎异常。\n[h2] 音乐美术 [/h2]\n游戏的画面是像素风格的，主要是以暖色调为主，给人一种温馨治愈的感觉，而游戏的整体氛围也是如此。游戏中有着大量的装饰和家具素材，虽然是像素风格，但是细节做的很棒，还有很多猫猫地垫等等非常可爱。而游戏的音乐也比较契合游戏，属于比较轻松欢快的电子音乐，搭配上各种音效声音，玩起来非常舒服。\n[h2] 总结 [/h2]\n作为一款轻松治愈带有解谜元素的游戏，本作非常值得推荐，不仅仅是玩法上吸引人，游戏的剧情做的也很棒，推荐给喜欢《Unpacking》玩法的玩家入手。\n\n\n[quote]欢迎关注[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45214439/]轻游社[/url]，以轻松认真的态度，对待每一款游戏\n[/quote]",

There's a LOT of secrets to uncover, though that part was a little overwhelming for me. I kept feeling like I was missing out on stuff. \nI liked the cleaning aspects, and petting the animals was fun. There's also a big open world with a lot of secrets, too.\n\nCons: Some things weren't explained very well - like the gachapon system with unlocking items\nFor me, some of the secrets in the game was kind of *too* creepy, especially for a cozy game\n\nFor my reaction/ first 1.5 hours of gameplay, https://youtu.be/MMKSDFelc0M",

First of all, the world is really big, and there are tons of different stores / areas that you can organize. The art itself is really nice and cozy, and there is so much furniture, plants, rugs, and general stuff to unlock. There's also a lot of different areas and stores that you can unlock, so it never gets boring.\n\nPlayers get the space to decorate their own areas freely, but also unpack furniture in other houses so the aesthetic is always changing. There's a central storyline, but you could totally run around and spend your time decorating if you wanted to. There are no penalties in the game, no time restrictions, generally no harsh rules on where you have to put things, and a lot a lot of areas. \n\nWORTH YOUR MONEY!",

      "review": "非常惊喜的一款摆放整理类游戏，unpacking的超豪华升级版。\n全成就时长在6-7小时左右，被医院的毛巾bug耽搁了一会，不过修得挺快，当天就解决了。给定关卡之外有3幢属于自己的房子和若干自由度较大的样板房构建，喜欢装修的朋友能用丰富的家具把玩更多时长。\n在基础的家具摆件丰富度、互动音效方面都做得比较优秀。可能是害怕纯粹的环境叙事留白太大，制作组不遗余力地用10-30不等的小字描绘几乎每个物品的前世今生或基本概况。\n以拆封摆放为基础，加入了打扫、盲盒抽取、解谜探索等玩法，再加上写过那么点的剧情，玩家体验主线的全程都趣味横生。白天干订单，晚上扫街压马路：全镇的垃圾桶、旧纸箱、消防栓、灌木丛、小猫咪、小垃圾都归本清洁工管！\n爱大地图探索找隐藏的有福了，由于不可剧透的原因，现实与蓝图相撞会形成许多难以解释的异常。出门遛弯走个三五步，工作时突然起了玩心，都能跳个成就鼓励你。\n欢迎i像素、i整理、i探索入坑，首发50花得不亏。",

      "review": "[h2]A Cosy, Curious Town[/h2]\n\nWhisper of the House is a dream if you love tidying, decorating, and discovering little secrets. You help townsfolk move, clean, and organise their homes and shops, all while uncovering hidden stories. The town has quirky characters, interactive objects, and plenty of tiny mysteries tucked away in every corner.\n\nWith over 1,800 items and full creative freedom, you can decorate exactly how you want. Lamps, TVs, and even bakery ovens all react when you interact with them, making every room feel alive. You can take your time, follow quests, or just decorate your own space. The pixel art is gorgeous, soft on the eyes, and paired with calm, non-intrusive music that really sets the mood. You can walk around, interact with characters, and discover all sorts of playful easter eggs. \n\nCompared to Unpacking, this game adds side quests, gacha furniture, and lots of interaction. It’s soothing and full of surprises—truly everything Unpacking could have been, and then some... There are even a few eerie secrets that leave you wondering what lies beneath this wholesome town.",

I'm sure that for people who do enjoy decorating this game would be even more pleasant, as the story took maybe 3h to complete, but there is plenty to do after finishing the main campaign.\r\nDidn't encounter any bugs and the performance (save for a few loading hiccups) was very good.",

What feels at first like just decorating and organizing turns into something deeper, with each home whispering its own little story. I love how free it feels. you can stack things in weird places, find random objects around town, and even stumble on spooky little secrets that make the world feel alive.\nThe cozy atmosphere is perfect, but at the same time it has this mysterious undertone that keeps me curious. Helping the villagers doesn’t feel like chores, it feels like you’re taking care of them in a very personal way.\nIf you liked Unpacking but wished for more freedom, exploration, and hidden lore, this game is 100% worth it.\n🌸 Cozy, creative, and a little eerie in the best way. Highly recommend <3",

      "review": "[h1]温馨小镇下的汹涌暗流，家政工拯救世界！——「呓语小镇」[/h1]\n《呓语小镇》是一款像素风解谜游戏，定档8月27日正式上架Steam。玩家在游戏中扮演一位家政工，来到这个温馨的呓语小镇，但是却嗅到了一丝异常的味道......玩家要做的就是完成委托要求的所有内容，在这个过程中，你也许会发现一些小秘密。\n\n[h2]家政工的日常[/h2]\n家政工这个职业其实在现实中也很常见，甚至可以说每个地区都有从事这个工作的人，工作的内容也很庞杂，主要就是完成雇主提出的任务，细分下来有打扫卫生，收纳整理，搬运家具等等。在游戏中玩家扮演的主角隶属于一个搬家公司，核心工作内容就是上门摆放家具和打扫卫生。\n\n小机器人马克会协助玩家工作，点击机器人就可以拿出家具，再进行合理的摆放。当然不乏有雇主对摆放的位置有特殊要求，根据他们的指引完成即可。\n\n一间房子中会有好几个房间，比如卧室、厨房、卫生间、客厅等等，每个房间都有一个单独的进度，放置家具可以增长进度，达到100%后就代表这个房间装修完成了。将全屋全部达到100%就算完成任务啦。\n\n除了放置家具外，主要工作内容中还有一项打扫卫生，有的顾客希望翻新房子，玩家右键点击污渍清扫，点击破损的家具可以将其拆分成废材，最后将所有垃圾和废材全部扔进垃圾桶就完成任务啦。值得一提的是，垃圾桶设计的很可爱，如果试图将不是垃圾的东西扔进垃圾桶，那么它就会说“请不要投喂垃圾！”，好像也没什么问题，毕竟对它来说垃圾才是美食。\n\n最后，完成任务的同时还需要击碎这个小镇中的异常，异常可能潜伏在任何物品上，症状也比较明显，散发着紫色光芒，不断向外扩散奇怪的符文，并且伴有轻微抖动。右键疯狂点击就可以击碎异常，使被附身的东西恢复正常。\n\n[h2]小镇的故事及个人体验[/h2]\n背景故事中，玩家来到呓语小镇从事家政工，但并没有这么简单，在玩家来之前就有一座神秘的凭空金字塔出现在小镇中，奇怪的是人们无法进入期内，唯一的可疑的点只有金字塔上闪烁的一个数字，除此之外再无其他的线索。\n\n主角在完成家政任务中击碎异常后，金字塔上的数字就会变少，这代表了什么？数字清零后是否可以进入金字塔了呢？金字塔内到底有什么呢？这些就不剧透啦，小伙伴们自行探索哦~\n\n地图上可以探索的东西很多，小摊贩，自动售货机，杂物堆等等都可以探索。玩家完成家政任务后会获得代金券，代金券可以去抽取家具，家具可以用来装修自己的房子或者打造样板间。后期完成大卖场的任务后也可以直接进入其中购买指定家具，就不需要随机抽取了，不过抽卡也是别有一番乐趣的。\n\n[h2]个人玩法与感受[/h2]\n完成特定的雇主任务后，玩家会获赠房屋，玩家可以在这些房间中用获取的家具进行装修，多套房子可以使用多种风格，发挥你的想象力和主观能动性，数千种家具可以搭配出无数种方案。\n\n游戏整体还是比较治愈的，画风很可爱，虽然是像素风格但是非常精细，地图上包含的内容很多，绝对不是滥制粗工。\n\n游戏中对于人物的刻画也很细致，只要深入探索就可以发掘很多NPC身上发生的故事，儿时的梦想，亲情的桎梏，友情的美好等等。\n\n这里就要夸夸游戏的支线了！支线通常是不会直接告诉玩家的，玩家在完成家政任务中会遇到NPC，细心一点的对话后再去完成NPC的请求就可以完成支线，很多支线藏得很好，通常三顾其而不知都是可能的，这也侧映了游戏很耐玩，有太多未知的事务等着玩家探索呢~\n\n[h2]写在最后[/h2]\n其实还是有点反差的，在一开始我只以为是一款轻松治愈的经营模拟类游戏，没想到游戏中竟然还包含了解密和拯救世界的要素，该说不说确实使游戏变得更加有趣耐玩了，谁能拒绝做一个大隐隐于市的拯救世界的英雄呢？妥妥的漫威主角剧本。\n\n游戏中获取家具的方式包含抽奖和直购，照顾到了几乎所有玩家群体，我个人就很享受抽奖的过程，基本都是去抽取的。但也不排除有的小伙伴被抽卡折磨得毫无体验，所以游戏中还设置了直购，免除抽卡的繁琐。\n\n最后希望小伙伴们享受家政工的琐碎日常，用心去发现和装饰美好的明天~\n[quote]关注鉴赏组：[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45134494]浮生评测[/url] ←\"浮生若梦，一鉴倾心，邀您共赏人间烟火\"\n加入Steam组：[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/LLFLLFF]浮生评测[/url]←“一起追寻'浮生若梦'般的游戏体验”\n开始“浮生若梦”鉴赏组的奇幻之旅！[/quote]",

      "review": "A first look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF37nAx6Neg\n\nI've always been a big fan of the unpacking game, and it'll always hold a place in my heart. But I also feel like the developers took inspiration from it and went above and beyond with that concept. And to be honest, I'm all here for it!\n\nWhispers of the House is a delightful, cozy game, coated with some mystery and secrets. Give or take, I may have missed some here and there. And even despite officially getting the thank you for playing end credits, I'm planning to jump in for another round. See if I can find some more, since I have at least one I haven't solved or figured out yet, and it has me intrigued. And this is special, at least to me, because we all know I can't play games back to back. Yet this one seems to be my one exception. At this point, I'm already hoping and rooting to see another one. I need more of this. A lot more.\n\nThat being said, I do have some feedback, but nothing that would be a deal breaker for me to stop playing. It's more about making minor improvements here and there. To make it even better!\n*~One of those things is that I have no idea if I collected all the items. Okay, the ones you haven't bought yet, with the cute voucher system, are greyed out. But to me, that's still a bit unclear. I would love to see a counter that shows x out of 100 items so that I can be sure. \n*~I almost lost an item behind something I couldn't move, and it took me 20 minutes to get it back out from behind that thing. Perhaps for essential items, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have them reset when needed. Perhaps with a respawn button of some sorts? \nAnd there is a chance there were a few more thingies that I've forgotten about by now, since I recorded and played a few days ago. If needed, I'll update. <3\n\nBut that's it for me now, in a nutshell. I can wholeheartedly vouch for this little gem, and I genuinely hope to see another one, or some DLC, as I mentioned earlier. I think it's an amazing and fun game. One you don't want to stop playing. One that makes you relax and yet gives you that little bit of mystery, making you go oooh. Oowh. Ooooe! Cozy with a dash of excitement.\n\nAt some point, I'll probably update my review, possibly to make it a little more polished and all that, as this was drafted quickly to show my early support and in an attempt to lure you into playing... what? at least I'm honest!-since I genuinely feel like this one is so, so worth a playthrough. ^_^ \n\n",

      "review": "Whisper of the House is a fun and relaxing game about cleaning, organizing, and decorating with main story content is about 10 hours.\n\n《呓语小镇》是一款以清洁、整理和装饰为核心的趣味休闲游戏，其主线剧情内容时长约 10 小时。\n\n[h3]Gameplay[/h3]\nYou take on the role of a moving assistant, cleaner, and home organizer, accompanied by a cute robot. Together, you help townspeople with tasks like moving into and settling down in their new homes or shops—this includes organizing spaces, decorating (you can arrange furniture however you like, giving you full creative freedom with no time limits; take as much time as you want!), and providing cleaning services to tidy up their messy residences and sort their belongings.\n\nNearly every item in the game includes an explanation, helping you gain a deeper understanding of your clients’ personal stuff. The game also features a wide variety of furniture, many with interactive surprises: you can turn on lamps, twist water taps, switch on the TV, hear a clang when moving a glass bottle, bake bread in a bakery, and more—there are plenty of little details waiting for you to find out!\n\nCurrently, the game offers over 1,800 pieces of items including food, carpets, furniture items, and utensils, 15+ story chapters, and 18 missions across different themes. Beyond designing residential homes, you’ll also help clients with commercial spaces like bakeries, convenience stores, workshops, and music stores—all set across more than 10 unique house layouts. Additionally, there are mysterious elements for you to uncover, solve, and collect.\n\nIn this lovely town, you’ll also meet 30 unique, charming townsfolk, each with their own stories and personalities. By completing tasks for them after you received a letter of request from them, you’ll build connections that may unlock some hidden mysteries. Keep an eye out for mysterious cracks in some residents’ homes—these lead to secret mystery rooms! Once you’re satisfied with your design work, you can show it off using the Showroom Mode (which includes photo filters) to take pictures of your creations and and finalize your job. You can also revisit clients’ homes anytime to interact with them or redecorate to your heart’s content. What’s more, your clients sometimes send gifts to your home—don’t forget to check them out!\n\nWhen you are not on your job, you can explore the neighborhood where you live to find hidden items by rummage through trash bins around town. There are also various shops that sell blind boxes via a gacha system, allowing you to collect exclusive furniture pieces. You even have your own house to redecorate—use the items you have collected to create your dream home, adding a sandbox element to the game. The town feels alive with dynamic weather: sunny days, rain, and snow. You can also take a break by sitting on benches around town to relax and enjoy the scenery.\n\nNote: You won’t be able to carry over save data from the demo version. Instead, you’ll receive 2,000 vouchers for playing the demo—more than enough to get lots of furniture from the gacha store!\n\n游戏玩法 \n你将扮演一名搬家助手、清洁员兼家居整理师，与一只可爱的机器人伙伴携手合作。你们共同协助镇上居民处理各类事务，比如帮他们搬入新家或新店并安顿下来 —— 具体工作包括空间整理、家居装饰（你可以随心所欲地摆放家具，拥有完全的创作自由，且无时间限制，想花多久打造都可以！），以及提供清洁服务，帮居民清理杂乱的住所、整理个人物品。\n\n游戏中几乎每件物品都附有说明，能让你更深入地了解客户的私人故事与物品背后的意义。此外，游戏还包含种类丰富的家具，其中不少带有互动惊喜：你可以打开台灯、拧开水龙头、开启电视，移动玻璃瓶时能听到清脆的碰撞声，还能在面包店里烤制面包…… 还有诸多趣味小细节等待你去发现！\n\n目前，游戏内提供超过 1800 件物品（涵盖食物、地毯、家具及各类厨具）、15 个以上的故事章节，以及 18 个不同主题的任务。除了设计居民住宅，你还需协助客户打造商业空间，如面包店、便利店、工坊和音乐商店等 —— 这些场景分布在 10 多种独特的房屋布局之中。同时，游戏内还藏有诸多神秘元素，供你探索、破解与收集。\n\n在这座可爱的小镇上，你还会遇到 30 位性格各异、独具魅力的居民，每个人都有专属的故事与个性。当你收到他们的委托信后，完成对应的任务就能与他们建立羁绊，而这份羁绊或许会帮你解锁一些隐藏的秘密。记得留意部分居民家中的神秘裂缝 —— 它们会通向隐秘的 “神秘房间”！当你对自己的设计成果满意时，可通过 “展示厅模式”（内含多种照片滤镜）拍摄作品、分享成果，同时完成当前工作。你也可以随时回访客户的家，与他们互动，或是随心所欲地重新装饰空间。更贴心的是，客户有时会给你家寄来礼物，可别忘了去查看！\n\n在不工作的时候，你可以探索自己居住的社区，翻找镇上的垃圾桶，说不定能发现隐藏物品。镇上还有多家商店售卖盲盒（通过扭蛋系统获取），让你有机会收集限定家具。你甚至拥有属于自己的房子，可利用收集到的物品重新装饰，打造梦想中的家园，为游戏增添了 “沙盒创作” 的乐趣。小镇的天气动态多变，晴天、雨天、雪天交替出现，充满生活气息。你也可以在镇上的长椅上坐下休息，放松身心，欣赏周边风景。\n\n注：演示版的存档无法转移至正式版，但游玩演示版可获得 2000 张代币 —— 用这些代币足以在扭蛋商店兑换大量家具！\n\n[h3]Art and Music[/h3]\nThe game’s charming pixel art—paired with smooth animations—creates a cozy, colorful atmosphere that brings the town and all its elements to life. A soothing soundtrack complements the game’s relaxed pace, enhancing the overall calm vibe.\n\n美术与音乐\n游戏采用可爱的像素画风，搭配流畅的动画效果，为小镇及所有游戏元素营造出温馨多彩的氛围，让整个世界鲜活起来。舒缓的背景音乐与游戏从容的节奏相得益彰，进一步烘托出宁静放松的整体基调。\n\n[h3]Summary[/h3]\nWhisper of the House delivers a fun, cozy, and therapeutic experience centered on cleaning, organizing, and decorating homes and shops—all while uncovering small mysteries. You can also explore the town and decorate your own dream home, with no time restrictions to rush you. The lovely pixel art style and the rich selection of over 1,800 detailed items that crafted by care and the interactivity of in-game objects breathes fresh, engaging life into the decorating genre. If you enjoyed games like Unpacking, you willdefinitely want to give this one a try!\n\n《呓语小镇》围绕房屋与店铺的清洁、整理和装饰展开，同时融入了探秘元素，为玩家带来趣味十足、温馨治愈的游戏体验。你可以自由探索小镇、装饰自己的梦想之家，全程无时间压力，无需匆忙赶工。可爱的像素画风、1800 余件精心设计的细节物品，再加上游戏内可互动的道具设计，为 “装饰类游戏” 注入了新鲜活力与趣味。如果你喜欢《拆箱》这类游戏，那么《屋之私语》绝对值得一试！\n\n[h3]11/10[/h3]\n\n[quote]欢迎关注鉴赏家: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/DCYXJLB] 大川游戏俱乐部 [/url]\n欢迎加入Steam组:[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45300930] 大川游戏俱乐部 [/url]\n来一起感受游戏的乐趣喜欢这篇评论，也是可以顺手点个赞哟[/quote]",
