If you ever liked games like Unpacking where you get to see cute pixel item by pixel item pop out of a box and then decide 100% yourself where you want to place them, all while being under no time pressure at all - this one's for you! I loved the anomalies all around, the little plant and alchemy puzzles had me buzzing as well. It's such a chill and pretty game whether it's for achievement hunters (that sweet ping sound!) or for relaxing furniture collecting and room building enthusiasts! I really enjoyed this game.",

      "review": "一款很细腻的游戏，本高共感星人玩得相当投入，虽然实际游玩时长只有八小时左右，但可以说各种情绪都走了一遍。看到好闺蜜搬到一起住，我和她们一样满心期待，忍不住想象每一件物品在未来生活中的使用场景；穿越时空回到爷爷还在的那个家，各种物品与生活痕迹也让我想起和奶奶一起生活的点滴；在收拾荒凉的海边小屋时，看着它逐渐恢复生机，仿佛自己也回到了无忧无虑的童年（谁懂看到阿衰的救赎感）。整个游戏最让我难受的还是为爱猫的黑帮老太收拾遗物，不忍心一点一点擦去她和那些小猫存在过的痕迹，所以我想尽可能的把屋子里的东西全部打包带走，尤其是小猫叼来的小野花和小瓶盖，还有老人自制的猫咪玩具....（略），总之我是能塞夺少塞夺少了，嗯！\n其实有些房间的收纳对我来说与其说是在帮别人布置房间更像在自己的脑海里寻找过去，每掏出一件物品就唤起了一段尘封的记忆。",

I LOVED the game Unpacking so so much, so I just knew this one would be right up (or is it down?) my alley. \n\nThere’s something so deeply satisfying about unpacking and decorating each little space. Every room has its own story, and I found myself slowing down just to get things “right.” The whole process scratches that same cozy itch as cleaning or organizing in real life... but minus the mess, of course. \n\nI also love how much personality it has. There are hidden surprises when you interact with random objects, and a few cheeky pop culture references that actually made me laugh. It feels like the devs had fun making this, and that vibe totally comes through.\n\n100 % done and dusted in 8 ish hours, so I am not unhappy.",

Nothing is too hard, while not a lot is explained, context clues are all over the place (as well as notes in some homes to help, of course), and after figuring something out, getting that achievement really boosts the incentive to keep playing. \r\nI like that theirs a mini collection system in the game too, with decorations you can pull from shops. Gotta love a gotcha system.\r\nI had a blast, I only wish it were longer now. I say go in blind if you're into decoration games because this one has a lot of fun secrets you don't want spoiled.",

The convenience stores felt very unsatisfying in particular because there didn't feel to be a good way to organize everything to my own satisfaction due to some of the pixel constraints. Not being able to put all the soda bottles in the fridge because only certain rows could double stack, etc.\r\n\r\nThis was a fun time, don't get me wrong.

It's not just unpacking either, there's tons of content where you can buy homes or showrooms to furnish with what you find through gameplay as well. If you're a sims 4/house flipper/any furnishing game then you'll definitely like that aspect of freedom too. Lots of variety, lots of challenges, plenty of content. The story is cute, the localization is fine (devs are chinese - the game has plenty of chinese culture referenced in it, but also has seasonal decor from other cultures worldwide. the dia de los muertos stuff was a pleasant surprise lmao) \nhighly, highly, highly recommend. the price of the game compared to the content is absolutely stellar!",

There are some wonky parts to it- it isn't the most intuitive thing to play (I had to use a walk-through because the game doesn't explain much to you), and it does have some English localization issues (I can understand everything as a native English speaker, but I did have to read some things a few times to understand what the game meant). Overall, though, it is a pretty enjoyable game that clearly had a lot of love poured into it. It's a decent investment if you're looking to play a relatively short game that has some chill post-game content. I managed to beat the game in about eight hours of laid-back play, but I can still continue to play and decorate little houses.",

Isso, na minha opinião, torna o jogo profundo e cria uma atmosfera acolhedora, que faz o jogador se sentir parte daquela história.\n\nJoguei por 10 horas até platinar, e com certeza vou continuar por muito mais tempo graças ao alto fator de replay. Mesmo após o fim da história principal, a rejogabilidade permanece praticamente intacta - o jogo parece te chamar para continuar explorando, testando cores, mobílias e combinações de decoração. É [i] surrealmente [/i] divertido e relaxante.\n\n[quote=Whisper of the House] May the light never fade, and your kindness remain forever. [/quote]",

That being said, it is not that hard to find the anomalies and such. Some may think that is a bad thing, but I believe the game is charming in that it is easy to do the task you set out to do and relax.

The pixel art is amazing and very expressive. Overall, if you like a game where you decorate homes you'll most likely like it. If you like solving mysteries, you'll have fun with all the secrets the game holds.\r\n\r\nA couple of things I didn't really like:\r\n- The decorating feels kind of limited. You can't change the color of most items and the color selection is very limited, even with the color picker tool. You can't really mess with saturation all that much and some colors come out very bright or very dark.\r\n\r\n- Almost all the bathrooms were absolutely tiny so you are very limited to how much detail you can put in them. You can't even change the shape of your bathroom and are stuck with the walk in shower set up.\r\n\r\n-The ending felt a little disappointing but it does wrap everything up nicely. So it wasn't a bad ending just a bit anti-climatic.\r\n\r\n*SPOILERS*\r\n\r\n\r\n- The houses you get as rewards near the end of the game are basically just theme rooms and you can't change the wallpaper or flooring. Which I find very odd, since you given these homes and not like, reselling them/renting them out.",

The game on release had a wide variety of furniture and decor. I hope it keeps receiving updates! My only real complain is that there is no character customization and the gameplay gets extremely repetitive after you complete the main story line. The side jobs repeat frequently, it starts to feel like there is really nothing else to do. Overall it's great and definitely worth the $15. <3",

      "review": "I absolutely ADORE cozy games (and more so when they've got a little kick to them). Whisper of the House (WotH) is a charming and cute indie pixel art game where you work as an interior designer by helping clients settle in the town. But that aside, you also notice over time how some tidbits look and feel unusual and mysterious - creepy, even. \r\n\r\nComparing this to Unpacking is a disservice to both games! While both are about making a home, WotH feels more free; in a sense that the player can place whatever they want wherever. Not only do you get to decorate people's houses as well, but also your own! It's an optional side that you can do with an extra feature of gacha on furniture by using \"tickets\" you get from completing missions and rummaging through trash (which is the best part of the game fr)\r\n\r\nIn comparison to Unpacking, WotH feels more episodic. It places value in each client's personal story through the way they want their home decorated in contrast to Unpacking where you only really look at only one person's life. Despite this difference, both games are outstanding in their own right and both WotH AND Unpacking are very deserving of praise for its cozy, comforting, and zen vibe.\r\n\r\nOverall, this game is wonderful and if you're an avid cozy game enjoyer for room designing w really good graphic and visual design like me, you are sure to love experiencing this game as much as I did. Easiest 9/10!",

Will highly recommend it if you enjoy games like Unpacking and wish you could do the same for other NPC's and not just for the main character. There is such a variety in tasks you need to do (Decorate your own home / Unpack how you want / Unpack but the way I want you to / I have this idea with a few items and want you to add to it) which makes every task feel different! Not to mention the subtle storylines going on as well!\r\n\r\nOnly downside is that the main story with the pyramid feels a bit out of place? Might be cause it wasn't there during the demo, but the way it ties in to our experience felt a bit out of place (might just be me though, but I kind of thought there would be more to it based on how strange some of the 'glitch' interactions were).\r\n\r\nI think we also get wayyyy too much vouchers for tasks (and too quickjly)! Let us grind and work for those furnishing pieces to decorate our homes! I do love that the gatcha furnishing stores prioritise giving you new items rather than copies of already-obtained versions (you can buy copies at the mall at least!) to ensure that you can unlock all items easier rather than it being a pure gatcha.",

The two things that take this game from great to incredible are: 1) The open-world aspect filled with looting and bonus adventures, and 2) A rich storyline with comedy and mystery combined. They still nailed all of the basics too. The cozy unpacking and decorating gameplay is excellent. The furniture/decor collection progress is great, there is a broad range of decor types and level challenges to incentivize progress. At around 10 hours, I feel like I still have a lot of creative fun and exploration left and I can't wait to see where this game continues to go.",

      "review": "This is a lovely game that's fairly short. The dev team is still actively working on it and doing bug fixes so I won't mention the ones I've encountered as I'm sure they're already fixed. It has a tame but still present unnerving vibe(?) It's hard to explain and I don't think spooky really describes the feeling and atmosphere but I would describe it as mildly disturbing in the sense you might feel a tad uneasy. This feeling is very scant and only really ramps up in the latter end of the game and i enjoyed it as it adds a layer of suspense. That said, the ending feels accurate to the story's progression but it falls a bit flat. Just a tad underwhelming and the plot of the game is very minimal.\n\nDespite the minimal plot, I enjoyed the overall game because I love organizing simulators and it's art style adds a fresh and exciting look to it compared to most other organization simulators (the only other organization game that ive played that has pixel art like whisper of the house is Unpacking by Witchbeam). I like the customization but i feel it could be more robust. All in all, it's a solid game it just might not be as polished as one may expect as the devs are still finding their footing for the game, but I don't mind that as the gameplay is the main draw for me and this game definitely has some replayability for me.",

      "review": "A very cute pixel organizing game similar to \"Unpacking\", albeit with a background Christian bent, where \"Unpacking\" was made by a Jewish developer and had Jewish elements (which is unfortunately rather unique in the video game space). That being said, \"Whisper of the House\" was a bit more enjoyable than \"Unpacking\" in some ways, in that the quests were quite fun, it didn't crash (though it had a number of lag issues that looked like near-crashes), and it identified objects for the player to move around. It's also a little longer and there's more stuff to do, although that made it a bit overwhelming at times, and I think the game is more targeted at people who like to make cute house designs than people who just like organizing things.\n\nOne of my main criticisms of \"Unpacking\" was that I didn't know what all the objects you handle were, so it was hard to figure out which room was the correct one for them. Although \"Whisper of the House\" generally sticks you in the right room for whatever object you're given (with the option of switching rooms as needed, though this is rarely necessary outside personal desire), the game also not only names whatever the object is, but also describes it. The descriptions aren't always useful, but the naming is.\n\nThere are issues with near-crashing: whenever a character would I think leave a screen, the screen would go entirely black, and the game would very obviously lag. During the end cutscene, the game froze, and then jumped a couple seconds forward. I also recall dealing with leg on clicking things at times (particularly with the gacha stuff), which was frustrating. While I appreciate the game is self-contained and has no microtransactions while containing gacha design elements, like games like \"Vampire Survivors\", I found this pretty aggravating because it does the \"Kirby and the Forgotten Land\" thing, where you can get repeat items rather than drawing from a narrower pool. This was irritating in \"Astro Bot\" as well, where you could spend hard-earned money to buy junk instead of items from the remaining pool. Considering just how many items there are in the game and how many pulls you have to do on average for them, it's very silly that you can collect things you already have when doing pulls, especially when it has no microtransactions so there's no intelligent reason to keep people making pulls, other than that's just how gacha tends to work.\n\nThe pixel art is very cute, and I appreciated the slight \"Stardew Valley\" and \"Gravity Falls\" vibes, with plenty of clear love for Studio Ghibli. The game does feel a bit overwhelming in moments, with a fast day-to-night cycle (that admittedly doesn't do anything other than matter for I think one item), and a small deluge of quests you get at once, until you discover everything is basically optional and the map has a pin system so you can set markers for yourself to go to if you get lost. The freedom and sense of narrative is nice, but I did appreciate \"Unpacking\"'s more linear narrative.\n\nI was also really confused, from a narrative angle, why the game keeps giving you [spoiler]homes to live in. By the time the ending rolled around, I'd gotten a handful of places to live in, on top of living rent free(?) in two different apartments, so I was a bit confused why I was meant to be excited about being gifted a house and too much stuff to stick in it, cute as the furniture is[/spoiler]. This is why I pointed out that the game seems more geared towards folks who like rearranging pretty fake houses than folks who like organizing, because this game design aspects seems to be geared towards giving the former more of what they want. And that's great for the former, but a bit underwhelming if you're not as into that part and just want puzzle-solving. I'm also a bit disappointed [spoiler]we didn't get to have a pet. The mysterious dog is never explained, and we don't get to keep the cat(s) that are wandering around. But I did appreciate the aquarium[/spoiler]. Additionally, while the town is nice, [spoiler]it's mostly empty. So the town aspect (rather than just focused on building to building, as \"Unpacking\" does) felt a bit wasted, since most of the neat-looking buildings and areas aren't places you can visit[/spoiler]. I also wish there were more buildings with [spoiler]people showing you where to put things. I get it defeats the purpose for some stuff, but it was satisfying in its own way[/spoiler].\n\nFrom a designer point, storage was also quite irritating. The [spoiler]present boxes are very cute, for instance, but you can neither store nor even trash them, so they just filled up my basement[/spoiler].\n\nIt was also very weird to find [spoiler]when you click the cop car, whoever's in it says \"Comrade\", like... the  pigs are communists? I'm so confused. I also wonder why a police station that serves no purpose (other than removing an unhoused person off-screen) was more important than other town facilities, like a dump or a school[/spoiler].\n\nThis can also be very hard on your hands, given some segments require continuous clicking. \"Gemporium\" actually had an accessibility feature for this, allowing a single button press to replace multiple ones. It was frustrating not to see that here.\n\nGenerally, though, it's a simple little game, with cute designs and fun puzzles. If you liked \"Unpacking\", you'll probably like this. If you liked this, you should try \"Unpacking\".",

Все, что нужно делать в игре - кайфовать, медитативно расставлять предметы и кайфовать еще больше!\r\n\r\nБольшие плюсы, которые привлекли мое внимание:\r\n1. Визуал. Приятная яркая пиксельная графика добавляет шарма игре про декорирование микро-комнаток.\r\n2. Сюжет. Порадовало, что здесь есть пара зАгАдОЧнЫх моментов и даже концовка.\r\n3. Атмосфера и таинственность. Меня покорил уровень с кладбищем и церковью, бууу\r\n4. Интерактивность. Почти всё в этой игре можно потискать и пожмякать, сплошной восторг!\r\n\r\nНебольшие минусы:\r\n1. Нет перевода на русский. Приходилось иногда напрягать голову, чтобы прочитать описания персонажей или понять, что за предмет и куда его ставить. В игре хочется расслабиться, но инглиш порой напрягал (хотя я его более менее знаю)\r\n2. Вкусновато, но маловато. сюжет, как по мне, очень быстро кончился, хоть и прошло 10 часов. Мне не хватило таинственности, все вроде как начали закручивать и тут бам, музей открылся, а там уже и концовка. ХОЧУ ИСЧО!\r\n3. Гача. Покупка предметов для дизайна через гачу - подлость (особенно ради ачивки)\r\n\r\nВ целом, игра вообще супер, похожих на нее не знаю, очень порадовала, рекомендую!!!",

I beat the main story and still have some little areas to work on, which I fully intend to do. I deeply enjoyed this game. With that being said, yes I'm going to be that person. It would have been nice to have a customized character. There really isn't a reason why we have to choose between two genders and one skin tone in 2025. It could have just been pick the body frame, pick the skin tone, pick the hair, and be done with it. That was my only hang up with this game. That, and a tiny bit more guidance could have been given.  However, this game easily paid for itself.",

      "review": "i would recommend this game, but i do have complicated feelings about it. \nthis game is incredibly charming and reeaallyyy fun. the unpacking mechanics are so nice and having the different levels makes it really enjoyable and unique. I am so captivated by the tiny glimpses of story you get with each level, but at the same time I feel confused talking to npcs. Each narrative is so random and kind of half baked, it makes me want more but they're so short lived and inconclusive that it leaves me feeling pretty dissatisfied. This game is kind of mysterious, which I like, but the 15 levels available don't feel like enough to me. You kind of get thrown all of these levels, and then everything comes to a stand still. I walked around the town for half an hour trying to figure out what I was missing. \nI just think for a game that is so interesting at it's core, it needs a more structured playing experience.",

No missable achievements and completion takes around 7 hours. \n\n[b]Approximate time to 100%:[/b] Around 7 hours\n[b]Estimated achievement difficulty:[/b] 1/10\n[b]Minimum number of playthroughs needed:[/b] 1\n[b]Is there a good guide available:[/b] Yes, I used this one: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3556988145\n[b]Multiplayer achievements:[/b] No\n[b]Missable achievements:[/b] No, you can return to the town after the ending\n[b]Grinding Achievements:[/b] No\n[b]DLC-Only achievements:[/b] No\n[b]Speedrun achievements:[/b] No\n[b]Time-gated achievements:[/b] No\n[b]RNG-achievements:[/b] A tiny bit, the achievement \"Failed to Take in\" requires some luck, but buy the big box with more items to go faster, and maybe save before purchasing the items in case you don't get it. I'm unsure if that is even possible. I still had a lot of credits when I got it.\n[b]Does difficulty affect achievements:[/b] No difficulty option, you can use the in-game hints during missions\n[b]Unobtainable/glitched achievements:[/b] No\n[b]Gamepad or mouse and keyboard:[/b] Mouse and Keyboard\n\nAs someone who enjoyed Unpacking but wished it told a little bit more of a story, this one fills that gap. I was already blown away by how gorgeous the game looks, but having the unpacking gameplay combined with a mystery to solve and helping people sort/clean their properties was so much fun! I also love that we have a robot helper. Please don't ask how the box he is holding contains all those items, as that is a mystery in itself. But your robot buddy is so cute! \n\nWhat is also nice is that most of the time, you have a choice between properties to go for; in the end, you'll do them all, but it is nice that the game gives you the option of which one you want to do next. Walking around the town to find weird stuff is also so much fun. Later on, you'll unlock a bus pass so you don't have to walk all the way, but I kinda never used it, as I even enjoyed the time strolling through town, and the city isn't so big that it takes a long time.\n\nThere are a few missions where some items have a fixed spot, but most of the missions you're totally free to place items wherever you want. Most people who enjoy this type of game would like to organize the items, and that is totally possible, but there isn't a \"wrong\" spot for an item. You have a lot of freedom. There are also side objectives and dailies, which offer even more freedom to design the house however you want. However, those are optional and not required for the achievements.\n\nSpeaking about the achievements, none of them are missable. There are a lot tied to the missions, but there are always secrets within the missions and secrets to find in the town. They aren't missable because you can continually re-enter a building and change things around, or research through them again. What may not be clear from the start is that if you see a glitched item, keep clicking on it with the right mouse button until it is no longer glitching. You'll also unlock an achievement at that point. \n\nAfter going through the ending, you get back into town and can still enter houses. Playing through it yourself first and then looking up solutions to things you couldn't find is a valid strategy and highly recommended. It's just so much fun figuring it out by yourself! \n\nI give Whisper of the House 4.5 out of 5 stars. \n\n\n[code]Do you enjoy games that don't have missable achievements?

      "review": "Have you ever wanted to move to a mysterious town to become a housekeeper, interior designer, and paranormal investigator all at once? Well boy do I have the game for you! Whisper of the House drops you into a cute and vibrant little town, where the townspeople will pay you to clean, organize, and design homes and businesses. But you start to encounter some... weird objects, not to mention the anonymous and vaguely threatening letters you start receiving in the mail. \n\nOh, and you can pet cats!\n\nThe gameplay primarily consists of completing jobs for the townspeople (which progresses the story), fixing \"anomalies,\" decorating your own homes (you start with one, and acquire 2 more throughout the game), and taking \"model home\" requests. There are also a few minigames -- making potions, mixing drinks, and growing unique plants (which you can then use to decorate with). Finally, you can wander around the town, which is just so cute and cozy!! It's rewarding to explore, because there are anomalies and secrets hidden around town, and sometimes you'll also run into characters you've helped previously. You can also raid crates and trash cans to find items, and you can find tokens scattered around.\n\nThe decorating mechanics are super simple and satisfying! Everything you pick up/set down makes a little sound that relates to what it is, which I love. The organization and decorating are VERY reminiscent of unpacking (another game I love, and probably a majority of Whisper players also love, LOL) but Whisper is more focused on the aesthetic/creativity aspect than the organization aspect (for example, there are a lot less drawers/cabinets to organize things in; there are a few, but mostly items are placed where they're visible). You can layer certain objects and even cause some objects to interact with each other (such as the ice cream cones and ice cream maker) to create new ones. \n\nDifferent jobs require different things from you as the housekeeper -- some are more focused on cleaning, some require you to place items in specific spots, and some simply ask you to decorate as you see fit. One of the cool things about this game is the variety of places you get to work on -- not only homes and apartments, but also different businesses, and even a cemetery. \n\nThere is a huge variety of items, some of which make up themed sets. Furniture, appliances, decor, print items, plants, rugs, and food/drink can all be bought at different stores and vending machines around town, which are marked on the map. They're acquired through a blind box/gacha mechanic, but it's really easy to get tokens, so it's not stressful or difficult to unlock all the items. You'll be paid tokens after each job, when you're \"promoted\" by the company, and after completing model home requests. \n\nAt the mall, you can buy duplicates of any furniture you have unlocked. For food and drink, you can buy duplicates at the convenience stores, and for plants, at the Flower Shop. I spent SO MUCH time just decorating and making spaces look cute and cozy, I'm sure I could have finished the game faster but I was having so much fun. There are no time penalties or deadlines, so I suggest taking it at whatever pace you want! \n\nThroughout the game, you get to know some really fun characters and help them with more than just organizing their homes. The little character stories are actually really heartwarming and adorable! Make sure to return to the homes and businesses you worked on, because some of the characters have secondary requests. I thought I was stuck for a while because no more requests were triggering, but I still had a missing character and anomalies... turns out I didn't know how to trigger one of the character's secondary requests. \n\nOverall, the game is pretty straightforward, and you can get most of the achievements and find most of the anomalies as long as you thoroughly explore and investigate everything. I got around 80/89 achievements by myself, and used a guide for the rest. There are a few things that are a little convoluted, the worst one (in my opinion) being the issue I mentioned before about triggering a characters request. Quick spoilers ahead in the following paragraph:\n\n/BEGIN SPOILERS/\n\nI got stuck after having completed all but one of the jobs in town, because I didn't know how to trigger Luna's secondary request. I had found the secret room and even interacted with the mousetrap, but when I returned to talk to her in response to her letter, I didn't get the hint about what I was supposed to do. She says something like \"I hear sobbing at night, and noises in the bathroom.\" Ok, so I thought, I need to go check the secret room again as well as the bathroom. I click around, nothing happens. What you're meant to do is take the mousetrap from the secret room, put it in the bathroom, then wait a day and you'll receive a Daily Whisper about a homeless person being found in her apartment, as well as a letter from her asking you to come help her again (her secondary request). Honestly I don't get how you're expected to figure that out, the mousetrap is just one of many random cluttered items in the secret room and she makes no mention of rats or animals of any kind, just \"noises\" and \"sobbing.\" I think if she had said something like \"I wonder if there are animals?\" after mentioning the noises, it might have clicked? I dunno if this is just me but that was frustrating because you're meant to finish that quest line early in the game, but I didn't get to it until near the end when I finally looked at a guide.\n\n/END SPOILERS/ \n\nBesides my issue with Luna's requests, I only have small complaints about the game. Honestly, it instantly became one of my favorites -- it's just basically everything I love in one game. But here are my small criticisms, and some requests:\n\n-All items should be able to be rotated all 4 ways. Certain items in the game can only be rotated 2 ways. Also, sometimes items that normally CAN be rotated 4 ways become locked into 2-way rotation when they're stacked (ex. a TV on top of a TV stand: both items by themselves can normally rotate 4 ways, but when stacked, they can't. If you un-stack them, rotate them to the position you want, then stack them again, it works). \n-Please add a search function for the storage! The filters are sometimes helpful, but sometimes not so much. Especially once you have all the items, finding a specific one can be very tedious. I think the best solution would be the option to search items by name. Being able to narrow down into smaller categories would also be good (ex. \"bedframes,\" \"computers\")\n-This one is probably a long shot, and it's not so much a criticism as just a request for future development. I would looveeee character customization! Doesn't have to be crazy or anything, but a few hair styles/colors and different outfits would be amazing. It made me sad looking at the cute clothes and wigs used as decor items in the game and wishing my character could wear them T_T\n-Also perchance a long shot but... pets? Cats are a pretty big part of the game, and there's already the coding allowing us to pet the ones in town, plus lots of pet-related decor items. I would love it if we could take in a cat (or dog) that could either just sit or walk around one of our houses (and could be pet of course). \n-And finally... please more content!!! Pretty please a sequel or DLC or something. I want more jobs and more Whisper Town lore!!! No pressure, I know it takes time and effort but I hope there will be more eventually! <3",

      "review": "여러 사람들의 집 안 가구를 배치해 주고 청소를 해 주는 인테리어 담당자가 되어, 주민들과 친해지며 마을의 비밀을 알아가는 이야기.\n\nWhisper of the House 는 Whisper 마을의 하우스키퍼로 취직한 이후 여러 명의 주민들을 만나 그들의 부탁 (집 안 가구 배치를 적절하게 해주기) 를 들어주고 각 인물들에 대해 가볍게 알아간다는 기본적인 스토리라인에, 마을 전체를 이곳저곳 돌아다니며 찾을 수 있는 기묘한 물체들을 하나하나 해체하면서 마을 속 숨겨진 비밀들을 찾는 기묘한 이야기가 겹쳐져 있는 게임이다. 전자의 경우, \"어 이거 뭔가 익숙하네?\" 라고 느껴질 수 있는 게임플레이인데, 약 4년 전 출시한 Unpacking 을 플레이 해 봤다면 매우 익숙한 맛을 여기서 다시 한 번 맛볼 수 있다. 여러 가지 자잘한 가구들과 사물들을 하나씩 꺼내서 집 안에 차곡차곡 쌓아가는 재미와, 비좁은 공간 안에 원하는 대로 가구들을 배치하다가 게임과 싸우는 나 자신을 보게 될 것이다. 사실 이 과정을 순수하게 재미로 따진다면 그렇게 재미와 도파민이 넘쳐나는 게임은 아니다. 몇백 개의 디지털 오브젝트들을 마우스로 눌러 드래그하면서 배치하는 과정을 재미있게 느끼는 사람은 많지 않지만, 재미의 범위를 좀 더 넓게 잡아서 \"머리를 비우고 무아지경의 상태에 빠져서 화면 속 물체들을 정렬하는 데서 오는 편안함\" 을 재미의 일부분으로 볼 수 있다면, 이런 유형의 게임 (직소 퍼즐 맞추기, 생활 시뮬레이션 게임 플레이 등등) 을 재미있게 할 사람은 많을 것이다. 그런 의미에서, Unpacking 도 그렇고 이 게임도 그렇고 솔직히 말해서 사이버 노동 게임에 가까운 게임플레이를 보여주고 있지만, 여러 집 안 가구 배치를 하는 데에서 재미와 편안함을 느낄 수 있었고, 비록 특정 사이드 컨텐츠 (게임 내 재화를 벌 수 있는 반복 퀘스트로, 사람들이 원하는 테마의 방을 만들어 주면 되는 퀘스트가 있는데, 개인적으로 메인 스토리까지 딱 즐기는 데서 게임이 줄 수 있는 편안함 게이지를 모두 채웠기 때문에, 게임플레이가 노동으로 느껴지는 역치점을 넘기기 전에 엔딩을 보고 게임을 껐다) 를 즐기지는 않았으나 엔딩을 볼 때까지 게임플레이가 너무 불쾌하게 느껴지지 않았다. 만약 이 평가를 쓰는 사람의 Unpacking 평가를 읽었다면 \"아니 그 게임은 비추천을 남겼으면서 이 게임은 왜 추천을 남겼냐?\" 라고 물어볼 수 있다. 그 이유는 사실 게임의 세부적인 구조의 차이에서 볼 수 있는데, Unpacking 의 경우 게임의 처음부터 끝까지 한 인물이 나이를 먹으면서 이사하는 과정을 그린 게임이라, 좋게 보면 스토리라인이 일관성을 지니고 있어서 괴랄하게 느껴질 부분이 없다는 장점이 있고, 나쁘게 보면 스토리가 정말 잔잔하다 못해 아무런 파동이 느껴지지 않는 호수를 관찰하는 기분이라 스토리 면에서는 꽤 지루했다는 단점이 있다. 왜 캐주얼 힐링 게임에서 스토리 이야기를 꺼내냐고 할 수 있지만, 게임플레이가 짐을 풀고 가구를 정리하는 큰 구조에서 절대로 벗어나지 않으며 모든 스테이지가 너무 비슷비슷하게 느껴지기 때문에 스토리라도 멱살잡고 플레이어의 관심을 잡아야 하는 게임이었는데 이를 실패해서, 게임을 하는 과정 및 게임 속 품은 이야기가 재미있게 느껴지지 않았다.\n\nWhisper of the House 는 게임플레이 (짐을 정리하는 과정) 및 스토리 면에서 나 같이 집중력이 적은 사람들이 중간에 게임을 접지 않도록 어느 정도 조치를 취한 모습을 보이는데, 게임플레이 면의 경우 짐을 정리하는 레벨들이 이 게임의 핵심이기는 하지만, 소소하게 숨겨져 있는 퍼즐들을 풀어 나가는 재미 및 숨겨진 물체 / 상호작용들을 찾는 재미가 있었고, 각각의 스테이지가 자신만의 개성을 자랑할 수 있도록 스테이지 별 테마 및 가구들을 다양하게 배치해 두었다. 특히 마음에 들었던 건 해변가에 있는 오두막이었는데, 바다 테마의 벽지와 가구들을 보면서 \"나도 저런 집에 살고 싶다 .... \" 라는 생각이 저절로 들게 되었다. 비록 여러 가지 테마를 배치하기 위해 비현실적인 설정들 - 두 번째 스테이지를 완료하면 마법과 관련된 집 정리 스테이지가 나오기에, 진짜 현실적인 게임을 기대했다면 좀 당황할 수 있다 - 이 들어가 있다는 게 마음에 안 드는 사람들도 있을 것이지만, 개인적으로는 그렇게 마음에 걸리는 특징은 아니었다. 스토리 또한 여러 가지 인물들을 만나고 그들을 도와주는 게 주요 내용이며, 물론 스토리 기반 게임들에 비하면 내용이 많이 부실한 건 사실이지만 그래도 다양한 사연 및 특징을 지닌 인물들을 넣어 두어서, 하나의 사연을 충분히 맛 봤다고 생각하면 또 새로운 스테이지를 던져 주면서 게임의 분위기를 지속적으로 바꾸고 환기한다는 장점이 있다. 특이하게도 게임 내 엔드 컨텐츠는 마을을 탐험하는 게 아니라 내 집을 꾸미는 것 및 모든 가구 / 오브젝트를 찾는 것인데, 후자의 경우는 게임을 진행하다 보면 얻을 수 있는 게임 내 재화를 이용해 뽑기를 하여서 여러 가지 가구들을 모을 수 있고, 생각보다 그 종류가 매우 많아서 모든 가구를 찾는 건 솔직히 말해 이 게임에 애정이 넘치치 않는 이상 적당히 절반 정도만 모으고 그 이상은 손이 가지 않을 것이다. 전자의 경우, 게임을 많이 진행하면 무려 나만의 집을 선물받게 되고 온갖 가구들을 같이 선물로 받는데, 직접 하다가 상자 안 자잘한 가구들이 너무 많아서 중간에 그만두고 얌전히 스토리나 진행하려고 나왔지만, 이런 장르의 게임플레이에 환장하는 사람이라면 몇 시간 정도는 그냥 태울 수 있는 컨텐츠다. 아무튼, Unpacking 과 비교해서 무엇이 더 우위에 있는 게임이라고 말할 수는 없으나, 여러 가지 컨텐츠와 다양한 테마의 가구들을 보여 주어서 Unpacking 을 하며 느꼈던 단조로움을 비슷한 구성의 이 게임에서 덜 느꼈다는 건 마음에 들었다.\n\n사실 이보다 호불호가 더 갈릴 법한 건 첫 번째 문단에서 적은 내용의 후자인데, 놀랍게도 이 게임의 숨겨져 있는 스토리라인은 일상물과는 거리가 좀 먼 스토리라인이며, 이를 해금하기 위해 (엔딩을 보기 위해) 찾아야 하는 물체들 또한 그렇게 평범한 물체들은 아니다. 게임 속 마을을 돌아다니다 보면 + 다른 사람들의 집을 정리하다 보면 무언가 보라색으로 지지직거리면서 왜곡 효과가 들어간 오브젝트들이 보이는데, 이를 여러 번 클릭하면 왜곡 현상을 제거하고, 마을 좌측에 있는 비밀의 공간 위 숫자가 줄어든다. 당연히 과반수 이상의 왜곡된 물체를 찾으면 해당 공간이 열리며 엔딩을 볼 수 있고, 스토리 자체는 사실 좀 뜬금없기는 하지만 이보다 더 처참한 스토리 위주 게임을 봐 온 나로써는 \"뭐 이 정도면 그럭저럭 넘어갈 수 있겠는데?\" 라는 대가리 깨진 생각만 들었다. 비록 아기자기한 일상물 게임을 기대했다면 이렇게 스토리 방향이 미스터리로 틀어진 것에 대해 거부감을 느낄 수 있으나, 오히려 이 특징 때문에 마을 이곳저곳을 뒤지는 동기를 플레이어에게 제공해서 좀 더 몰입감을 높였다는 건 나쁘지 않다고 생각하며, 이 독특한 물체들을 찾는 과정이 너무 난해하지 않아서 외부의 공략 없이 자연스레 엔딩을 보기까지 필요한 수량을 채울 수 있었다. 특히, 이런 물체들로 인해 게임 내 숨겨진 다양한 상호작용을 보는 재미도 있었고 (예를 들어서, 두 번째 스테이지에서 반죽을 오븐에 넣어서 태워먹을 수 있다는 사실을 몰랐는데 공략을 보고 \"아니, 이런 것도 있었어?\" 라는 걸 알게 되었다) 이러한 왜곡된 물체들이 게임의 재미를 깎아먹는 건 아니었다고 생각한다. 특히 제일 귀여웠던 상호작용은 욕조에 고무 오리를 배치한 뒤 눌러보면 머리를 꾹 누르는 애니메이션이 나오는 것이었다. 별 거 아닌데 좌우로 고무 오리가 찌그러지는 게 너무 귀여웠다 ..... \n\n\n결론적으로, 아기자기한 가구들을 정리하는 재미와 나름 넓고 다양한 건물들을 탐방하며 게임 속 숨겨진 물체와 이벤트에 대해 알아가는 재미가 잘 어우러져 있는 잔잔한 캐주얼 장르의 게임이라 추천. 플레이타임의 경우 게임 100% 완료까지 약 6시간이 걸렸는데, 다른 스팀 평가들에 이보다 더 짧은 시간이 찍힌 경우가 많지 않다는 걸 생각하면 최소 플레이타임이 약 5 ~ 6 시간일 것으로 보인다. 가격 대비 플레이타임이 약간 애매하게 느껴질 수도 있으니, 직접 해보고 싶다면 가벼운 할인을 할 때 구매해서 해보는 걸 권장한다.\n\n여담) 스팀 업적의 경우 100% 완료하는 건 1회차 안에 할 수 있으며, 이미 정리를 완료한 집도 다시 들어가 볼 수 있기에 실수로 업적을 놓쳤다고 해도 업적과 관련되어 있는 장소로 다시 들어가는 게 어렵지 않다. 스팀 가이드에도 100% 업적 가이드가 있으니 만약 막힌다면 해당 공략을 참고하다 보면 무난하게 업적을 모두 딸 수 있을 것이다.",

But the game does feel a little half baked for a full release. There aren't very many locations to decorate, 15 at most which I feel is a very small amount for a full released game. I'm unsure of the developers plans for continued updates but I feel the game is missing a lot of content. There's so much potential here so I hope they continue support as this was a delightful little experience!",

      "review": "A first look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF37nAx6Neg\n\nI've always been a big fan of the unpacking game, and it'll always hold a place in my heart. But I also feel like the developers took inspiration from it and went above and beyond with that concept. And to be honest, I'm all here for it!\n\nWhispers of the House is a delightful, cozy game, coated with some mystery and secrets. Give or take, I may have missed some here and there. And even despite officially getting the thank you for playing end credits, I'm planning to jump in for another round. See if I can find some more, since I have at least one I haven't solved or figured out yet, and it has me intrigued. And this is special, at least to me, because we all know I can't play games back to back. Yet this one seems to be my one exception. At this point, I'm already hoping and rooting to see another one. I need more of this. A lot more.\n\nThat being said, I do have some feedback, but nothing that would be a deal breaker for me to stop playing. It's more about making minor improvements here and there. To make it even better!\n*~One of those things is that I have no idea if I collected all the items. Okay, the ones you haven't bought yet, with the cute voucher system, are greyed out. But to me, that's still a bit unclear. I would love to see a counter that shows x out of 100 items so that I can be sure. \n*~I almost lost an item behind something I couldn't move, and it took me 20 minutes to get it back out from behind that thing. Perhaps for essential items, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have them reset when needed. Perhaps with a respawn button of some sorts? \nAnd there is a chance there were a few more thingies that I've forgotten about by now, since I recorded and played a few days ago. If needed, I'll update. <3\n\nBut that's it for me now, in a nutshell. I can wholeheartedly vouch for this little gem, and I genuinely hope to see another one, or some DLC, as I mentioned earlier. I think it's an amazing and fun game. One you don't want to stop playing. One that makes you relax and yet gives you that little bit of mystery, making you go oooh. Oowh. Ooooe! Cozy with a dash of excitement.\n\nAt some point, I'll probably update my review, possibly to make it a little more polished and all that, as this was drafted quickly to show my early support and in an attempt to lure you into playing... what? at least I'm honest!-since I genuinely feel like this one is so, so worth a playthrough. ^_^ \n\n",

      "review": "I enjoyed this game a great deal, and it's a bummer to not be able to recommend this game on the merits of what it does well - but it truly does feel like a half-finished experience.\r\n\r\nThe parts that work are wonderful and memorable - two levels early in the story have incredible hidden secrets that truly make you feel smart for figuring them out. But the back half of the game becomes repetitive and relatively uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe game promises a great deal about a hidden story to unravel, but its most interesting ideas go totally unexplored and unexplained. There are big missing chunks of story here that can't help but feel like the dev just ran out of time, and disappointingly, it takes what could have been, I think, a truly incredible game to a pretty unmemorable one. The decorating is fun, but the economy has zero challenge whatsoever. You get thousands of 'vouchers' for completing easy in-game tasks, and after that can just spam the merchants, which only award furniture at random, to get everything you need. You can buy individual pieces - but only if you've unlocked them already, completely removing any incentive for doing so.\r\n\r\nThe decorating challenges, which I suspect were added to pad playtime, are pointless. Unlike some decorating games that 'tag' furniture with associated characteristics, adding an actual mechanic to decorating, the challenges in this game simply give you four or five pieces of furniture to put in a giant room, and then arbitrarily let you put down an amount of furniture (it never tells you how much). You could literally plonk down random items for ten seconds and would be rewarded with completing the challenge with full marks, which completely took the fun out of it for me.\r\n\r\nThe world-building is charming and the little interactions are super cool. The first two hours of this game showcase what it could have been, and I'm disappointed that it couldn't keep up that level of quality. Buy it on sale and enjoy it for what it is, but I can't recommend it for the listed price.",

There's several more in game things I can decorate and a lot of things left to collect, I also didn't spend much time on my own house - which I want to do. It's a fun little unpacking type game but with a lot of variety of homes and businesses, and theres some real spooky sht going on too which I like a lot. I'm also a scaredy cat with pretty much any kind of scary game and this isn't scary, just has some neat spooky vibes every so often.",

Conforme avanzas, conoces nuevos personajes que abren sus propios locales y te piden ayuda para organizarlos, lo que da una sensación de progreso en la ciudad bastante agradable.\n\nLo que más me ha gustado:\n-  Mantiene una atmósfera cozy, pero con un giro interesante: una historia de misterio que se va desarrollando mientras decoras. (Esto es lo que más me llamaba del juego y me alegro de que haya mantenido esa idea).\n- Casi todos los objetos se pueden colocar en distintas posiciones, lo que da mucha libertad creativa. También puedes modificar el suelo y pared de tu casa, aunque no en todas las zonas.\n- Gran variedad de ítems desbloqueables mediante el sistema tipo \"gacha\" (o gatcha), usando tickets que puedes conseguir buscando en la basura, vendiendo lo que no usas o cumpliendo tareas de decoración.\n\n\nLo que no me gusta:\n- No entiendo el mensajito de que pasan los días, igual he pasado algo por alto pero no le encuentro el sentido y me resulta a veces molesto.\n- Creo que voy a conseguir todos los items de cajas demasiado rápido porque me premian con demasiados tickets. Igual en un futuro van a tener que sacar una expansión con más elementos decorativos para que pueda seguir gastando mis tickets, jajaja.\n\nEn general, es una propuesta diferente y muy entretenida. Si te gustan los juegos tranquilos de decoración, pero además quieres una pizca de intriga, puede gustarte.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDEUTSCH:\nBevor ich anfange, möchte ich sagen, dass ich das Spiel noch nicht durchgespielt habe.\nIch habe ein paar Bugs gefunden, die ich bereits gemeldet habe, aber mir gefällt es bisher, und ich wollte eine Rezension schreiben – vor allem für die Leute, die die Demo ausprobiert haben und nicht wussten, ob nach dem Vorfall mit dem geheimen Raum zu viel geändert werden würde.\n\nWhisper of the House ist ein Einzelspieler-Spiel, bei dem das Hauptziel darin besteht, deinen neuen Nachbarn beim Auspacken und Einrichten ihrer Häuser und Geschäfte in einer wachsenden Stadt zu helfen. Während du voranschreitest, lernst du neue Charaktere kennen, die ihre eigenen Läden eröffnen und dich bitten, ihnen bei der Organisation zu helfen. Dadurch entsteht ein sehr angenehmes Gefühl von Fortschritt in der Stadt.\n\nWas mir am meisten gefallen hat:\n\n- Es behält eine gemütliche Atmosphäre bei, aber mit einem interessanten Twist: eine Mystery-Geschichte, die sich nach und nach entwickelt, während man dekoriert. (Das war das, was mich am meisten am Spiel gereizt hat, und ich freue mich, dass diese Idee beibehalten wurde).\n- Fast alle Objekte können in verschiedenen Positionen platziert werden, was viel kreative Freiheit gibt. Außerdem kann man den Boden und die Wände des eigenen Hauses verändern – allerdings nicht in allen Bereichen.\n- Große Vielfalt an freischaltbaren Items durch ein Gacha-ähnliches System, mit Tickets, die man bekommen kann, indem man im Müll sucht, unbenutzte Dinge verkauft oder Dekorationsaufgaben erfüllt.\n\nWas mir nicht gefällt:\n- Ich verstehe die kleine Nachricht über die vergehenden Tage nicht. Vielleicht habe ich etwas übersehen, aber für mich ergibt sie keinen Sinn und ist manchmal eher störend.\n- Ich glaube, dass ich alle Items aus den Kisten zu schnell bekommen werde, weil man zu viele Tickets geschenkt bekommt. Vielleicht müssen sie in Zukunft eine Erweiterung mit mehr Dekorationsobjekten herausbringen, damit ich meine Tickets weiter ausgeben kann, haha.\n\nInsgesamt ist es ein anderes, aber sehr unterhaltsames Spiel. Wenn du entspannte Dekorationsspiele magst, aber auch ein wenig Spannung haben möchtest, könnte es dir gefallen.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nENGLISH:\nFirst of all, I want to say that I haven’t finished it yet.\nI’ve found a couple of bugs, which I already reported, but I’m enjoying it so far and I wanted to write this review for people who tried the demo and weren’t sure if they would change too much after the incident with the secret room.\n\nWhisper of the House is a single-player game where the main goal is to help your new neighbors unpack and decorate their houses and businesses in a growing town. As you progress, you meet new characters who open their own shops and ask for your help to organize them, which gives a very pleasant sense of progress in the town.\n\nWhat I liked the most:\n\n- It keeps a cozy atmosphere but with an interesting twist: a mystery story that slowly unfolds while you decorate. (This is the thing that most attracted me, and I’m glad they kept that idea).\n- Almost all objects can be placed in different positions, giving a lot of creative freedom. You can also change the floor and walls of your house, although not in every area.\n- Great variety of unlockable items through a gacha-like system, using tickets you can get by searching the trash, selling unused items, or completing decoration tasks.\n\nWhat I didn’t like:\n\n- I don’t understand the little message about the passing days. Maybe I missed something, but it doesn’t make sense to me and sometimes feels a bit annoying.\n- I think I’m going to get all the items from boxes too quickly because they reward you with too many tickets. Maybe in the future they’ll have to release an expansion with more decorative items so I can keep spending my tickets, haha.\n\nOverall, it’s a different but very entertaining game. If you like relaxing decoration games but also want a pinch of intrigue, you might enjoy it.",

And the collection is somewhat limited, but still cute.\r\nAlso a little sad that you can't recolor most of the furniture (however the existence of a colorwheel is awesome and lets you recolor some items just how you want it). \r\n\r\nControls are comfortable, graphics are cute\r\nSound is unintrusive and cozy\r\nStory is simple but fun, gives you goals to complete\r\nShort and sweet, completed in 7 hours. \r\n\r\n",

The movements of the character is also relatively smooth, luv it.\n\nHowever, with that being said, the game interface could have been better if it is a little more flexible in allowing us to turn all the objects 360 degree (and not selected ones). Also, I thought the rooms could be rotated but nope...its fixed.\n\nSo...other than the rotations, the game is generally great if you are someone who likes to arrange things.",

Ich bin mir aber sicher, dass noch weitere Stunden folgen werden, denn nach Beenden der Story gibt es noch genug zu tun ♡ \n\nIch habe lange nach ähnlichen Spielen wie Unpacking gesucht und bin hier rundum abgeholt worden. Ich hatte gar nicht damit gerechnet überhaupt eine \"übergreifende\" Story zu bekommen und war schon beim ersten Auftrag positiv überrascht (und auch ein bisschen verunsichert, ob es irgendwo ne Horror Genre Einordnung gab, die ich übersehen hatte...xD bin ängstlich, okay?). \nAnyway war ich tapfer und habe mich auch durch fragwürdige Möbelverteilung (was macht die Kamera da?!) nicht aufhalten lassen und Auftrag um Auftrag erledigt. Es wurde nie eintönig und bis ganz zum Schluss habe ich gehofft, dass es jetzt noch irgendwie weiter geht, weitere Stadtareale betretbar werden und ich das Gefühl bekomme die Story ist irgendwie \"abgeschlossen\".\n\nIch hoffe, dass wir in Zukunft noch das ein oder andere DLC sehen werden - ich habe das Gefühl die Geschichte rund um Whispertown ist noch nicht auserzählt. \n\nAlles in allem: große Empfehlung für alle, die Unpacking mochten und nicht nur gerne Pixelräume einrichten, sondern sich von einer cozy-spooky Story überraschen lassen möchten :3",

This definitely scratched that Unpacking type itch for me, and bonus points for having a lot of leeway in placing items and not being forced into putting things in certain spots to proceed. It look me 8 hours to 100% achievements, though keep in mind there hadn't been any guides created yet when I was playing so that last hour was mostly hunting for the last few.\n\nI think there are a couple improvements that could be made to the end and translations especially, if things were worded a bit better it would make things a lot more clearer to understand story-wise. But for me the gameplay is what I came for - and it very pleasantly exceeded my expectations. \n\nSome super creative level design here, and I love the option to play even longer with all the showroom options and personal houses to decorate if you wish. Would love to see more like this in the future.",

Think Unpacking, but with more whimsical lore and the occasional ghost.\n\nThe story is light and easy to follow. No over-complicated timelines or existential dread here. Just cozy mystery with a side of mild enchantment. The gameplay is smooth, intuitive, and blessedly ADHD-friendly. I 100%'d the whole thing in about 6 hours, and not once did my attention decide to yeet itself into the void.\n\nThe pixel art? Adorable.\nThe atmosphere? Relaxing.\nThe soundtrack? Melted into the background like a cup of warm tea and never once annoyed me.\n\nTop moments? The graveyard setting and EinSmart's Secret Lab made me do that little gamer giggle of joy when things are just right.\n\nSo if you’re into games that let you decorate, discover secrets, and unwind without the pressure of combat or cryptic puzzles... this one’s for you.\nWould recommend to anyone who enjoyed Unpacking, adores cute pixel art, or wants a whisper of the supernatural without the threat of possession.\n\nFinal verdict?\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Cozy chaos with a ghostly wink.",

      "review": "Even with my review, I thoroughly have enjoyed this game. It is quite simply an overarching mix between Unpacking, the Animal Crossing Happy Homes DLC, and it's own thing entirely. My major issues stem from the fact that the game barely teaches you how to play outside of the basic click and drag items function, as well as the lack of room interaction. I've not had the game explain to me anything about how to get more items, anything about its apparent cleaning of the city, it's scavenging mechanic, or anything really. My other major issue is it's lack of room storage. You're given food items, small bits and bobs, clothing, etc, yet nowhere to place them. For the majority of the game you have no closets, drawers, fridges, nothing. Nothing to open or store things in. This to me is extremely essential to a storage and decor game like this. Hopefully this can be changed in the future, as the game has a sort of professional class that is hard to find nowadays; that is to say it can definitely hold its own. I hope to be able to change this someday, either way thank you for the fun I did have, and heres to hopefully having more in the future.",
